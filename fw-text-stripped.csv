call themselves came at him from the westborders of the eastmidlands three kings of three suits and a crowner from all their cardinal parts along the amber way where Brosna's furzy To lift them they

puzzler he would likely be length by breadth nonplussing his thickness ells upon ells of him making so many square yards of him one half of him in Conn's half but the whole of him nevertheless in Owenmore's five quarters There would he lay till they would him descry spancelled down upon a blossomy bed at one foule stretch amongst the daffydowndillies the flowers of narcosis fourfettering his

bodiment atop of annywom her notion and the meet of their noght was worth two of his morning Up to the esker ridge it was Mallinger parish to a mead that was not far the son's rest First klettered Shanator Gregory seeking spoor through the deep timefield Shanator Lyons trailing the wavy line of his partition footsteps something in his blisters was telling him all along how he had been in that place one time then his Recordership Dr Shunadure Tarpey caperchasing after honourable sleep hot on to the aniseed and up out of his prompt corner old Shunny MacShunny MacDougal the hiker in the rere of them on the run to make a quorum Roping their ass he was their skygrey globetrotter by way of an afterthought and by no means legless either for such sprouts on him they were that much oneven it was tumbling he was by four lengths within the bawl of a mascot kuss yuss kuss cley patsy watsy like the kapr in the kabisses the big ass to hear with his unaided ears the harp in the air the bugle dianablowing wild as wild the mockingbird whose word is misfortune so 'tis said the bulbul down the wind The proto was traipsing through the tangle then Mathew Walker godsons' goddestfar deputising for gossipocracy and his station was a few perch to the weatherside of the knoll Asnoch and it was from no other place unless there how and ever that he proxtended aloof upon the ether Mesmer's Manuum the hand making silence The buckos beyond on the lea then stopped wheresoever they found their standings and that way they set ward about him doing obedience nod bend bow and curtsey like the watchers of Prospect upholding their broadawake prober's hats on their firrum heads the travelling court on its findings circuiting that personer in his fallen And a crack quatyouare of stenoggers they made of themselves solons and psychomorers all told with their hurts and daimons spites and clops not even to the seclusion of their beast by them that was the odd trick of the pack trump and no friend of carrots And what do you think who should be laying there above all other persons forenenst them only Yawn All of asprawl he was laying too amengst the poppies and I can tell you something more than that drear writer profoundly as you may bedeave to it he was oscasleep asleep And it was far more similar to a satrap he lay there with unctuous beauty all surrounded the poser or for whatall I know like Lord Lumen coaching his preferred constellations in faith and doctrine for old Matt Gregory 'tis he had the starmenagerie Marcus Lyons and Lucas Metcalfe Tarpey and the mack that never forgave the ass that lurked behind him Jonny na Hossaleen More than their good share of their five senses ensorcelled you would say themselves were fuming censor the way they could not rightly tell their heels from their stools as they cooched down a mamalujo by his cubical crib as question time drew nighing and the map of the souls' groupography rose in relief within their quarterings to play tops or kites or hoops or marbles curchycurchy gawking on him for the issuance of his pnum and softnoising one of them to another one the boguaqueesthers And it is what they began to say to him tetrahedrally then the masters what way was he  He's giving the wee bairn Yun has lived  Yerra why dat my leader  Wisha is he boosed or what alannah  Or his wind's from the wrong cut says Ned of the Hill  Lesten  Why so and speak up do you hear me you sir  Or he's rehearsing somewan's funeral  Whisht outathat Hubba's up And as they were spreading abroad on their octopuds their drifter nets the chromous gleamy seiners' nets and no lie there was word of assonance being softspoken among those quartermasters  Get busy kid  Chirpy come now  The present hospices is a good time  I'll take on that chap For it was

after him and from thence to the neighbour and that way to the puisny donkeyman and his crucifer's cauda And in their minds years backslibris so it was slipping beauty how they would be meshing that way when he rose to it with the planckton at play about him the quivers of scaly silver and their clutches of chromes of the highly lucid spanishing gold whilst as hour gave way to mazing hour with Yawn himself keeping time with his thripthongue to ope his blurbeous lips he would a let out classy the way myrrh of the moor and molten moonmist would be melding mellifond indo his mouth  Y  Before
