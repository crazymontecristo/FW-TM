IJ-1,20 NOVEMBER YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT YEAR OF GLAD I am seated in an office surrounded by heads and bodies. My posture is consciously congruent to the shape of my hard chair. This is a cold room in University Administration wood-walled Remington-hung double-windowed against the November heat insulated from Administrative sounds by the reception area outside at which Uncle Charles Mr. deLint and I were lately received. I am in here. Three faces have resolved into place above summer-weight sportcoats and half-Windsors across a polished pine conference table shiny with the spidered light of an Arizona noon. These are three Deans — of Admissions Academic Affairs Athletic Affairs. I do not know which face belongs to whom. I believe I appear neutral maybe even pleasant though I've been coached to err on the side of neutrality and not attempt what would feel to me like a pleasant expression or smile. I have committed to crossing my legs I hope carefully ankle on knee hands together in the lap of my slacks. My fingers are mated into a mirrored series of what manifests to me as the letter X. The interview room's other personnel include: the University's Director of Composition its varsity tennis coach and Academy prorector Mr. A. deLint. C.T. is beside me; the others sit stand and stand respectively at the periphery of my focus. The tennis coach jingles pocket-change. There is something vaguely digestive about the room's odor. The high-traction sole of my complimentary Nike sneaker runs parallel to the wobbling loafer of my mother's half-brother here in his capacity as Headmaster sitting in the chair to what I hope is my immediate right also facing Deans. The Dean at left a lean yellowish man whose fixed smile nevertheless has the impermanent quality of something stamped into uncooperative material is a personality-type I've come lately to appreciate the type who delays need of any response from me by relating my side of the story for me to me. Passed a packet of computer-sheets by the shaggy lion of a Dean at center he is speaking more or less to these pages smiling down. 'You are Harold Incandenza eighteen date of secondary-school graduation approximately one month from now attending the Enfield Tennis Academy Enfield Massachusetts a boarding school where you reside.' His reading glasses are rectangular courtshaped the sidelines at top and bottom. 'You are according to Coach White and Dean [unintelligible] a regionally nationally and continentally ranked junior tennis player a potential O.N.A.N.C.A.A. athlete of substantial promise recruited by Coach White via correspondence with Dr. Tavis here commencing .. . February of this year.' The top page is removed and brought around neatly to the bottom of the sheaf at intervals. 'You have been in residence at the Enfield Tennis Academy since age seven.’ I am debating whether to risk scratching the right side of my jaw where there is a wen. 'Coach White informs our offices that he holds the Enfield Tennis Academy's program and achievements in high regard that the University of Arizona tennis squad has profited from the prior matriculation of several former E.T.A. alumni one of whom was one Mr. Aubrey F. deLint who appears also to be with you here today. Coach White and his staff have given us —’ The yellow administrator's usage is on the whole undistinguished though I have to admit he's made himself understood. The Director of Composition seems to have more than the normal number of eyebrows. The Dean at right is looking at my face a bit strangely. Uncle Charles is saying that though he can anticipate that the Deans might be predisposed to weigh what he avers as coming from his possible appearance as a kind of cheerleader for E.T.A. he can assure the assembled Deans that all this is true and that the Academy has presently in residence no fewer than a third of the continent's top thirty juniors in age brackets all across the board and that I here who go by 'Hal' usually am 'right up there among the very cream.' Right and center Deans smile professionally; the heads of deLint and the coach incline as the Dean at left clears his throat: '— belief that you could well make even as a freshman a real contribution to this University's varsity tennis program. We are pleased' he either says or reads removing a page 'that a competition of some major sort here has brought you down and given us the chance to sit down and chat together about your application and potential recruitment and matriculation and scholarship.’ 'I've been asked to add that Hal here is seeded third Boys' 18-and-Under Singles in the prestigious WhataBurger Southwest Junior Invitational out at the Randolph Tennis Center —' says what I infer is Athletic Affairs his cocked head showing a freckled scalp. 'Out at Randolph Park near the outstanding El Con Marriott' C.T. inserts 'a venue the whole contingent's been vocal about finding absolutely top-hole thus far which —’ 'Just so Chuck and that according to Chuck here Hal has already justified his seed he's reached the semifinals as of this morning's apparently impressive win and that he'll be playing out at the Center again tomorrow against the winner of a quarterfinal game tonight and so will be playing tomorrow at I believe scheduled for 0830 —’ 'Try to get under way before the godawful heat out there. Though of course a dry heat.’ '— and has apparently already qualified for this winter's Continental Indoors up in Edmonton Kirk tells me —' cocking further to look up and left at the varsity coach whose smile's teeth are radiant against a violent sunburn — 'Which is something indeed.' He smiles looking at me. 'Did we get all that right Hal.’ C.T. has crossed his arms casually; their triceps' flesh is webbed with mottle in the air-conditioned sunlight. 'You sure did. Bill.' He smiles. The two halves of his mustache never quite match. 'And let me say if I may that Hal's excited excited to be invited for the third year running to the Invitational again to be back here in a community he has real affection for to visit with your alumni and coaching staff to have already justified his high seed in this week's not unstiff competition to as they say still be in it without the fat woman in the Viking hat having sung so to speak but of course most of all to have a chance to meet you gentlemen and have a look at the facilities here. Everything here is absolutely top-slot from what he's seen.’ There is a silence. DeLint shifts his back against the room's panelling and recenters his weight. My uncle beams and straightens a straight watchband. 62.5% of the room's faces are directed my way pleasantly expectant. My chest bumps like a dryer with shoes in it. I compose what I project will be seen as a smile. I turn this way and that slightly sort of directing the expression to everyone in the room. There is a new silence. The yellow Dean's eyebrows go circumflex. The two other Deans look to the Director of Composition. The tennis coach has moved to stand at the broad window feeling at the back of his crewcut. Uncle Charles strokes the forearm above his watch. Sharp curved palm-shadows move slightly over the pine table's shine the one head's shadow a black moon. 'Is Hal all right Chuck?' Athletic Affairs asks. 'Hal just seemed to ... well grimace. Is he in pain? Are you in pain son?’ 'Hal's right as rain' smiles my uncle soothing the air with a casual hand. 'Just a bit of a let's call it maybe a facial tic slightly at all the adrenaline of being here on your impressive campus justifying his seed so far without dropping a set receiving that official written offer of not only waivers but a living allowance from Coach White here on Pac 10 letterhead being ready in all probability to sign a National Letter of Intent right here and now this very day he's indicated to me.' C.T. looks to me his look horribly mild. I do the safe thing relaxing every muscle in my face emptying out all expression. I stare carefully into the Kekuléan knot of the middle Dean's necktie. My silent response to the expectant silence begins to affect the air of the room the bits of dust and sportcoat-lint stirred around by the AC's vents dancing jaggedly in the slanted plane of windowlight the air over the table like the sparkling space just above a fresh-poured seltzer. The coach in a slight accent neither British nor Australian is telling C.T. that the whole applicationinterface process while usually just a pleasant formality is probably best accentuated by letting the applicant speak up for himself. Right and center Deans have inclined together in soft conference forming a kind of tepee of skin and hair. I presume it's probably facilitate that the tennis coach mistook for accentuate though accelerate while clunkier than facilitate is from a phonetic perspective more sensible as a mistake. The Dean with the flat yellow face has leaned forward his lips drawn back from his teeth in what I see as concern. His hands come together on the conference table's surface. His own fingers look like they mate as my own four-X series dissolves and I hold tight to the sides of my chair. We need candidly to chat re potential problems with my application they and I he is beginning to say. He makes a reference to candor and its value. 'The issues my office faces with the application materials on file from you Hal involve some test scores.' He glances down at a colorful sheet of standardized scores in the trench his arms have made. 'The Admissions staff is looking at standardized test scores from you that are as I'm sure you know and can explain are shall we say ... subnormal.' I'm to explain. It's clear that this really pretty sincere yellow Dean at left is Admissions. And surely the little aviarian figure at right is Athletics then because the facial creases of the shaggy middle Dean are now pursed in a kind of distanced affront an I'm-eatingsomething-that-makes-me-really-appreciate-the-presence-of- whatever-I'm-drinking-along-with-it look that spells professionally Academic reservations. An uncomplicated loyalty to standards then at center. My uncle looks to Athletics as if puzzled. He shifts slightly in his chair. The incongruity between Admissions's hand- and face-color is almost wild. '—verbal scores that are just quite a bit closer to zero than we're comfortable with as against a secondary-school transcript from the institution where both your mother and her brother are administrators —' reading directly out of the sheaf inside his arms' ellipse — 'that this past year yes has fallen off a bit but by the word I mean "fallen off" to outstanding from three previous years of frankly incredible.’ 'Off the charts.’ 'Most institutions do not even have grades of A with multiple pluses after it' says the Director of Composition his expression impossible to interpret. 'This kind of ... how shall I put it... incongruity' Admissions says his expression frank and concerned 'I've got to tell you sends up a red flag of potential concern during the admissions process.’ 'We thus invite you to explain the appearance of incongruity if not outright shenanigans.' Students has a tiny piping voice that's absurd coming out of a face this big. 'Surely by incredible you meant very very very impressive as opposed to literally quote "incredible" surely' says C.T. seeming to watch the coach at the window massaging the back of his neck. The huge window gives out on nothing more than dazzling sunlight and cracked earth with heat-shimmers over it. 'Then there is before us the matter of not the required two but nine separate application essays some of which of nearly monograph-length each without exception being —' different sheet — 'the adjective various evalua-tors used was quote "stellar" —’ Dir. of Comp.: 'I made in my assessment deliberate use of lapidary and effete.’ '— but in areas and with titles I'm sure you recall quite well Hal: "Neoclassical Assumptions in Contemporary Prescriptive Grammar" "The Implications of Post-Fourier Transformations for a Holographically Mimetic Cinema" "The Emergence of Heroic Stasis in Broadcast Entertainment" —’ ' "Montague Grammar and the Semantics of Physical Modality"?’ ' "A Man Who Began to Suspect He Was Made of Glass"?’ ' "Tertiary Symbolism in Justinian Erotica"?’ Now showing broad expanses of recessed gum. 'Suffice to say that there's some frank and candid concern about the recipient of these unfortunate test scores though perhaps explainable test scores being these essays' sole individual author.’ 'I'm not sure Hal's sure just what's being implied here' my uncle says. The Dean at center is fingering his lapels as he interprets distasteful computed data. 'What the University is saying here is that from a strictly academic point of view there are admission problems that Hal needs to try to help us iron out. A matriculant's first role at the University is and must be as a student. We couldn't admit a student we have reason to suspect can't cut the mustard no matter how much of an asset he might be on the field.’ 'Dean Sawyer means the court of course Chuck' Athletic Affairs says head severely cocked so he's including the White person behind him in the address somehow. 'Not to mention O.N.A.N.C.A.A. regulations and investigators always snuffling around for some sort of whiff of the smell of impropriety.’ The varsity tennis coach looks at his own watch. 'Assuming these board scores are accurate reflectors of true capacity in this case' Academic Affairs says his high voice serious and sotto still looking at the file before him as if it were a plate of something bad Til tell you right now my opinion is it wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't be fair to the other applicants. Wouldn't be fair to the University community.' He looks at me. 'And it'd be especially unfair to Hal himself. Admitting a boy we see as simply an athletic asset would amount to just using that boy. We're under myriad scrutiny to make sure we're not using anybody. Your board results son indicate that we could be accused of using you.’ Uncle Charles is asking Coach White to ask the Dean of Athletic Affairs whether the weather over scores would be as heavy if I were say a revenue-raising football prodigy. The familiar panic at feeling misperceived is rising and my chest bumps and thuds. I expend energy on remaining utterly silent in my chair empty my eyes two great pale zeros. People have promised to get me through this. Uncle C.T. though has the pinched look of the cornered. His voice takes on an odd timbre when he's cornered as if he were shouting as he receded. 'Hal's grades at E.T.A. which is I should stress an Academy not simply a camp or factory accredited by both the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the North American Sports Academy Association it's focused on the total needs of the player and student founded by a towering intellectual figure whom I hardly need name here and based by him on the rigorous Oxbridge Quadrivium-Trivium curricular model a school fully staffed and equipped by a fully certified staff should show that my nephew here can cut just about any Pac 10 mustard that needs cutting and that —’ DeLint is moving toward the tennis coach who is shaking his head. '— would be able to see a distinct flavor of minor-sport prejudice about this whole thing' C.T. says crossing and recrossing his legs as I listen composed and staring. The room's carbonated silence is now hostile. T think it's time to let the actual applicant himself speak out on his own behalf' Academic Affairs says very quietly. 'This seems somehow impossible with you here sir.’ Athletics smiles tiredly under a hand that massages the bridge of his nose. 'Maybe you'd excuse us for a moment and wait outside Chuck.’ 'Coach White could accompany Mr. Tavis and his associate out to reception' the yellow Dean says smiling into my unfocused eyes. '— led to believe this had all been ironed out in advance from the —' C.T. is saying as he and deLint are shown to the door. The tennis coach extends a hypertrophied arm. Athletics says 'We're all friends and colleagues here.’ This is not working out. It strikes me that exit signs would look to a native speaker of Latin like red-lit signs that say HE leaves. I would yield to the urge to bolt for the door ahead of them if I could know that bolting for the door is what the men in this room would see. DeLint is murmuring something to the tennis coach. Sounds of keyboards phone consoles as the door is briefly opened then firmly shut. I am alone among administrative heads. '— offense intended to anyone' Athletic Affairs is saying his sportcoat tan and his necktie insigniated in tiny print — 'beyond just physical abilities out there in play which believe me we respect want believe me.’ '— question about it we wouldn't be so anxious to chat with you directly see?’ '— that we've known in processing several prior applications through Coach White's office that the Enfield School is operated however impressively by close relations of first your brother who I can still remember the way White's predecessor Maury Klamkin wooed that kid so that grades' objectivity can be all too easily called into question —’ 'By whomsoever's calling — N.A.A.U.P. ill-willed Pac 10 programs O.N.A.N.C.A.A. —’ The essays are old ones yes but they are mine; de moi. But they are yes old not quite on the application's instructed subject of Most Meaningful Educational Experience Ever. If I'd done you one from the last year it would look to you like some sort of infant's random stabs on a keyboard and to you who use whomsoever as a subject. And in this new smaller company the Director of Composition seems abruptly to have actuated emerged as both the Alpha of the pack here and way more effeminate than he'd seemed at first standing hip-shot with a hand on his waist walking with a roll to his shoulders jingling change as he pulls up his pants as he slides into the chair still warm from C.T.'s bottom crossing his legs in a way that inclines him well into my personal space so that I can see multiple eyebrow-tics and capillary webs in the oysters below his eyes and smell fabricsoftener and the remains of a breath-mint turned sour. '. . . a bright solid but very shy boy we know about your being very shy Kirk White's told us what your athletically built if rather stand-offish younger instructor told him' the Director says softly cupping what I feel to be a hand over my sportcoat's biceps (surely not) 'who simply needs to swallow hard and trust and tell his side of the story to these gentlemen who bear no maliciousness none at all but are doing our jobs and trying to look out for everyone's interests at the same time.’ I can picture deLint and White sitting with their elbows on their knees in the defecatory posture of all athletes at rest deLint staring at his huge thumbs while C.T. in the reception area paces in a tight ellipse speaking into his portable phone. I have been coached for this like a Don before a RICO hearing. A neutral and affectless silence. The sort of all-defensive game Schtitt used to have me play: the best defense: let everything bounce off you; do nothing. I'd tell you all you want and more if the sounds I made could be what you hear. Athletics with his head out from under his wing: '— to avoid admission procedures that could be seen as primarily athleticsoriented. It could be a mess son.’ 'Bill means the appearance not necessarily the real true facts of the matter which you alone can fill in' says the Director of Composition. '— the appearance of the high athletic ranking the subnormal scores the over-academic essays the incredible grades vortexing out of what could be seen as a nepotistic situation.’ The yellow Dean has leaned so far forward that his tie is going to have a horizontal dent from the table-edge his face sallow and kindly and no-shit-whatever: 'Look here Mr. Incandenza Hal please just explain to me why we couldn't be accused of using you son. Why nobody could come and say to us why look here University of Arizona here you are using a boy for just his body a boy so shy and withdrawn he won't speak up for himself a jock with doctored marks and a store-bought application.’ The Brewster's-Angle light of the tabletop appears as a rose flush behind my closed lids. I cannot make myself understood. 'I am not just a jock' I say slowly. Distinctly. 'My transcript for the last year might have been dickied a bit maybe but that was to get me over a rough spot. The grades prior to that are de moi.' My eyes are closed; the room is silent. 'I cannot make myself understood now.' I am speaking slowly and distinctly. 'Call it something I ate.’ It's funny what you don't recall. Our first home in the suburb of Weston which I barely remember — my eldest brother Orin says he can remember being in the home's backyard with our mother in the early spring helping the Moms till some sort of garden out of the cold yard. March or early April. The garden's area was a rough rectangle laid out with Popsicle sticks and twine. Orin was removing rocks and hard clods from the Moms's path as she worked the rented Rototiller a wheelbarrow-shaped gas-driven thing that roared and snorted and bucked and he remembers seemed to propel the Moms rather than vice versa the Moms very tall and having to stoop painfully to hold on her feet leaving drunken prints in the tilled earth. He remembers that in the middle of the tilling I came tear-assing out the door and into the backyard wearing some sort of fuzzy red Pooh-wear crying holding out something he said was really unpleasant-looking in my upturned palm. He says I was around five and crying and was vividly red in the cold spring air. I was saying something over and over; he couldn't make it out until our mother saw me and shut down the tiller ears ringing and came over to see what I was holding out. This turned out to have been a large patch of mold — Orin posits from some dark corner of the Weston home's basement which was warm from the furnace and flooded every spring. The patch itself he describes as horrific: darkly green glossy vaguely hirsute speckled with parasitic fungal points of yellow orange red. Worse they could see that the patch looked oddly incomplete gnawed-on; and some of the nauseous stuff was smeared around my open mouth. 'I ate this' was what I was saying. I held the patch out to the Moms who had her contacts out for the dirty work and at first bending way down saw only her crying child hand out proffering; and in that most maternal of reflexes she who feared and loathed more than anything spoilage and filth reached to take whatever her baby held out — as in how many used heavy Kleenex spit-back candies wads of chewed-out gum in how many theaters airports backseats tournament lounges? O. stood there he says hefting a cold clod playing with the Velcro on his puffy coat watching as the Moms bent way down to me hand reaching her lowering face with its presbyopic squint suddenly stopped froze beginning to I.D. what it was I held out countenancing evidence of oral contact with same. He remembers her face as past describing. Her outstretched hand still Rototrembling hung in the air before mine. 'I ate this' I said. 'Pardon me?’ O. says he can only remember (sic) saying something caustic as he lim-boed a crick out of his back. He says he must have felt a terrible impending anxiety. The Moms refused ever even to go into the damp basement. I had stopped crying he remembers and simply stood there the size and shape of a hydrant in red PJ's with attached feet holding out the mold seriously like the report of some kind of audit. O. says his memory diverges at this point probably as a result of anxiety. In his first memory the Moms's path around the yard is a broad circle of hysteria: 'God!' she calls out. 'Help! My son ate this!' she yells in Orin's second and more fleshed-out recollection yelling it over and over holding the speckled patch aloft in a pincer of fingers running around and around the garden's rectangle while O. gaped at his first real sight of adult hysteria. Suburban neighbors' heads appeared in windows and over the fences looking. O. remembers me tripping over the garden's laid-out twine getting up dirty crying trying to follow. 'God! Help! My son ate this! Help!' she kept yelling running a tight pattern just inside the square of string; and my brother Orin remembers noting how even in hysterical trauma her flight-lines were plumb her footprints Native-American-straight her turns inside the ideogram of string crisp and martial crying 'My son ate this! Help!' and lapping me twice before the memory recedes. 'My application's not bought' I am telling them calling into the darkness of the red cave that opens out before closed eyes. 'I am not just a boy who plays tennis. I have an intricate history. Experiences and feelings. I'm complex. 'I read' I say. 'I study and read. I bet I've read everything you've read. Don't think I haven't. I consume libraries. I wear out spines and ROM-drives. I do things like get in a taxi and say "The library and step on it." My instincts concerning syntax and mechanics are better than your own I can tell with due respect. 'But it transcends the mechanics. I'm not a machine. I feel and believe. I have opinions. Some of them are interesting. I could if you'd let me talk and talk. Let's talk about anything. I believe the influence of Kierkegaard on Camus is underestimated. I believe Dennis Gabor may very well have been the Antichrist. I believe Hobbes is just Rousseau in a dark mirror. I believe with Hegel that transcendence is absorption. I could interface you guys right under the table' I say. 'I'm not just a creãtus manufactured conditioned bred for a function.’ I open my eyes. 'Please don't think I don't care.’ I look out. Directed my way is horror. I rise from the chair. I see jowls sagging eyebrows high on trembling foreheads cheeks bright-white. The chair recedes below me. 'Sweet mother of Christ' the Director says. T'm fine' I tell them standing. From the yellow Dean's expression there's a brutal wind blowing from my direction. Academics' face has gone instantly old. Eight eyes have become blank discs that stare at whatever they see. 'Good God' whispers Athletics. 'Please don't worry' I say. 'I can explain.' I soothe the air with a casual hand. Both my arms are pinioned from behind by the Director of Comp. who wrestles me roughly down on me with all his weight. I taste floor. 'What's wrong?’ I say 'Nothing is wrong.’ 'It's all right! I'm here!' the Director is calling into my ear. 'Get help!' cries a Dean. My forehead is pressed into parquet I never knew could be so cold. I am arrested. I try to be perceived as limp and pliable. My face is mashed flat; Comp.'s weight makes it hard to breathe. 'Try to listen' I say very slowly muffled by the floor. 'What in God's name are those . . .' one Dean cries shrilly '. . . those sounds?’ There are clicks of a phone console's buttons shoes' heels moving pivoting a sheaf of flimsy pages falling. 'God!’ 'Help!’ The door's base opens at the left periphery: a wedge of halogen hall-light white sneakers and a scuffed Nunn Bush. 'Let him up!' That's deLint. 'There is nothing wrong' I say slowly to the floor. Tm in here.’ I'm raised by the crutches of my underarms shaken toward what he must see as calm by a purple-faced Director: 'Get a grip son!’ DeLint at the big man's arm: 'Stop it!’ 'I am not what you see and hear.’ Distant sirens. A crude half nelson. Forms at the door. A young Hispanic woman holds her palm against her mouth looking. 'I'm not' I say. You have to love old-fashioned men's rooms: the citrus scent of deodorant disks in the long porcelain trough; the stalls with wooden doors in frames of cool marble; these thin sinks in rows basins supported by rickety alphabets of exposed plumbing; mirrors over metal shelves; behind all the voices the slight sound of a ceaseless trickle inflated by echo against wet porcelain and a cold tile floor whose mosaic pattern looks almost Islamic at this close range. The disorder I've caused revolves all around. I've been half-dragged still pinioned through a loose mob of Administrative people by the Comp. Director — who appears to have thought variously that I am having a seizure (prying open my mouth to check for a throat clear of tongue) that I am somehow choking (a textbook Heimlich that left me whooping) that I am psychotically out of control (various postures and grips designed to transfer that control to him) — while about us roil deLint trying to restrain the Director's restraint of me the varsity tennis coach restraining deLint my mother's half-brother speaking in rapid combinations of polysyllables to the trio of Deans who variously gasp wring hands loosen neckties waggle digits in C.T.'s face and make pases with sheafs of now-pretty-clearly-superfluous application forms. I am rolled over supine on the geometric tile. I am concentrating docilely on the question why U.S. restrooms always appear to us as infirmaries for public distress the place to regain control. My head is cradled in a knelt Director's lap which is soft my face being swabbed with dusty-brown institutional paper towels he received from some hand out of the crowd overhead staring with all the blankness I can summon into his jowls' small pocks worst at the blurred jaw-line of scarring from long-ago acne. Uncle Charles a truly unparalleled slinger of shit is laying down an enfilade of same trying to mollify men who seem way more in need of a good brow-mopping than I. 'He's fine' he keeps saying. 'Look at him calm as can be lying there.’ 'You didn't see what happened in there' a hunched Dean responds through a face webbed with fingers. 'Excited is all he gets sometimes an excitable kid impressed with —’ 'But the sounds he made.’ 'Undescribable.’ 'Like an animal.’ 'Subanimalistic noises and sounds.’ 'Nor let's not forget the gestures.’ 'Have you ever gotten help for this boy Dr. Tavis?’ 'Like some sort of animal with something in its mouth.’ 'This boy is damaged.’ 'Like a stick of butter being hit with a mallet.’ 'A writhing animal with a knife in its eye.’ 'What were you possibly about trying to enroll this —’ 'And his arms.’ 'You didn't see it Tavis. His arms were —’ 'Flailing. This sort of awful reaching drumming wriggle. Waggling' the group looking briefly at someone outside my sight trying to demonstrate something. 'Like a time-lapse a flutter of some sort of awful ... growth.’ 'Sounded most of all like a drowning goat. A goat drowning in something viscous.’ 'This strangled series of bleats and —’ 'Yes they waggled.’ 'So suddenly a bit of excited waggling's a crime now?’ 'You sir are in trouble. You are in trouble.’ 'His face. As if he was strangling. Burning. I believe I've seen a vision of hell.’ 'He has some trouble communicating he's communicatively challenged no one's denying that.’ 'The boy needs care.’ 'Instead of caring for the boy you send him here to enroll compete?’ 'Hal?’ 'You have not in your most dreadful fantasies dreamt of the amount of trouble you have bought yourself Dr. so-called Headmaster educator.’ '. . . were given to understand this was all just a formality. You took him aback is all. Shy —’ 'And you White. You sought to recruit him!’ '— and terribly impressed and excited in there without us his support system whom you asked to leave which if you'd —’ 'I'd only seen him play. On court he's gorgeous. Possibly a genius. We had no idea. The brother's in the bloody NFL for God's sake. Here's a top player we thought with Southwest roots. His stats were off the chart. We watched him through the whole WhataBurger last fall. Not a waggle or a noise. We were watching ballet out there a mate remarked after.’ 'Damn right you were watching ballet out there White. This boy is a balletic athlete a player.’ 'Some kind of athletic savant then. Balletic compensation for deep problems which you sir choose to disguise by muzzling the boy in there.' An expensive pair of Brazilian espadrilles goes by on the left and enters a stall and the espadrilles come around and face me. The urinal trickles behind the voices' small echoes. '— haps we'll just be on our way' C.T. is saying. 'The integrity of my sleep has been forever compromised sir.’ '— think you could pass off a damaged applicant fabricate credentials and shunt him through a kangaroo-interview and inject him into all the rigors of college life?’ 'Hal here functions you ass. Given a supportive situation. He's fine when he's by himself. Yes he has some trouble with excitability in conversation. Did you once hear him try to deny that?’ 'We witnessed something only marginally mammalian in there sir.’ 'Like hell. Have a look. How's the excitable little guy doing down there Aubrey does it look to you?’ 'You sir are quite possibly ill. This affair is not concluded.’ 'What ambulance? Don't you guys listen? I'm telling you there's —’ 'Hal? Hal?’ 'Dope him up seek to act as his mouthpiece muzzling and now he lies there catatonic staring.’ The crackle of deLint's knees. 'Hal?’ '— inflate this publicly in any distorted way. The Academy has distinguished alumni litigators at counsel. Hal here is provably competent. Credentials out the bazoo Bill. The boy reads like a vacuum. Digests things.’ I simply lie there listening smelling the paper towel watching an es-padrille pivot. 'There's more to life than sitting there interfacing it might be a newsflash to you.’ And who could not love that special and leonine roar of a public toilet? Not for nothing did Orin say that people outdoors down here just scuttle in vectors from air conditioning to air conditioning. The sun is a hammer. I can feel one side of my face start to cook. The blue sky is glossy and fat with heat a few thin cirri sheared to blown strands like hair at the rims. The traffic is nothing like Boston. The stretcher is the special type with restraining straps at the extremities. The same Aubrey deLint I'd dismissed for years as a 2-D martinet knelt gurneyside to squeeze my restrained hand and say 'Just hang in there Buckaroo' before moving back into the administrative fray at the ambulance's doors. It is a special ambulance dispatched from I'd rather not dwell on where with not only paramedics but some kind of psychiatric M.D. on board. The medics lift gently and are handy with straps. The M.D. his back up against the ambulance's side has both hands up in dispassionate mediation between the Deans and C.T. who keeps stabbing skyward with his cellular's antenna as if it were a sabre outraged that I'm being needlessly ambulanced off to some Emergency Room against my will and interests. The issue whether the damaged even have interested wills is shallowly hashed out as some sort of ultra-mach fighter too high overhead to hear slices the sky from south to north. The M.D. has both hands up and is patting the air to signify dispassion. He has a big blue jaw. At the only other emergency room I have ever been in almost exactly one year back the psychiatric stretcher was wheeled in and then parked beside the waiting-room chairs. These chairs were molded orange plastic; three of them down the row were occupied by different people all of whom were holding empty prescription bottles and perspiring freely. This would have been bad enough but in the end chair right up next to the strap-secured head of my stretcher was a T-shirted woman with barnwood skin and a trucker's cap and a bad starboard list who began to tell me lying there restrained and immobile about how she had seemingly overnight suffered a sudden and anomalous gigantism in her right breast which she referred to as a titty; she had an almost parodic Québecois accent and described the 'titty's' presenting history and possible diagnoses for almost twenty minutes before I was rolled away. The jet's movement and trail seem incisionish as if white meat behind the blue were exposed and widening in the wake of the blade. I once saw the word KNIFE finger-written on the steamed mirror of a nonpublic bathroom. I have become an infantophile. I am forced to roll my closed eyes either up or to the side to keep the red cave from bursting into flames from the sunlight. The street's passing traffic is constant and seems to go 'Hush hush hush.' The sun if your fluttering eye catches it even slightly gives you the blue and red floaters a flashbulb gives you. 'Why not? Why not? Why not not then if the best reasoning you can contrive is why not?' C.T.'s voice receding with outrage. Only the gallant stabs of his antenna are now visible just inside my sight's right frame. I will be conveyed to an Emergency Room of some kind where I will be detained as long as I do not respond to questions and then when I do respond to questions I will be sedated; so it will be inversion of standard travel the ambulance and ER: I'll make the journey first then depart. I think very briefly of the late Cosgrove Watt. I think of the hypophalangial Grief-Therapist. I think of the Moms alphabetizing cans of soup in the cabinet over the microwave. Of Himself's umbrella hung by its handle from the edge of the mail table just inside the Headmaster's House's foyer. The bad ankle hasn't ached once this whole year. I think of John N. R. Wayne who would have won this year's WhataBurger standing watch in a mask as Donald Gately and I dig up my father's head. There's very little doubt that Wayne would have won. And Venus Williams owns a ranch outside Green Valley; she may well attend the 18's Boys' and Girls' finals. I will be out in plenty of time for tomorrow's semi; I trust Uncle Charles. Tonight's winner is almost sure to be Dymphna sixteen but with a birthday two weeks under the 15 April deadline; and Dymphna will still be tired tomorrow at 0830 while I sedated will have slept like a graven image. I have never before faced Dymphna in tournament play nor played with the sonic balls the blind require but I watched him barely dispatch Petropolis Kahn in the Round of 16 and I know he is mine. It will start in the E.R. at the intake desk if C.T.'s late in following the ambulance or in the green-tiled room after the room with the invasive-digital machines; or given this special M.D.- supplied ambulance maybe on the ride itself: some blue-jawed M.D. scrubbed to an antiseptic glow with his name sewn in cursive on his white coat's breast pocket and a quality desk-set pen wanting gurneyside Q&A etiology and diagnosis by Socratic method ordered and point-by-point. There are by the O.E.D. VI's count nineteen nonarchaic synonyms for unresponsive of which nine are Latinate and four Saxonic. I will play either Stice or Polep in Sunday's final. Maybe in front of Venus Williams. It will be someone blue-collar and unlicensed though inevitably — a nurse's aide with quick-bit nails a hospital security guy a tired Cuban orderly who addresses me as jou — who will looking down in the middle of some kind of bustled task catch what he sees as my eye and ask So yo then man what's your story? YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT Where was the woman who said she'd come. She said she would come. Erdedy thought she'd have come by now. He sat and thought. He was in the living room. When he started waiting one window was full of yellow light and cast a shadow of light across the floor and he was still sitting waiting as that shadow began to fade and was intersected by a brightening shadow from a different wall's window. There was an insect on one of the steel shelves that held his audio equipment. The insect kept going in and out of one of the holes on the girders that the shelves fit into. The insect was dark and had a shiny case. He kept looking over at it. Once or twice he started to get up to go over closer to look at it but he was afraid that if he came closer and saw it closer he would kill it and he was afraid to kill it. He did not use the phone to call the woman who'd promised to come because if he tied up the line and if it happened to be the time when maybe she was trying to call him he was afraid she would hear the busy signal and think him disinterested and get angry and maybe take what she'd promised him somewhere else. She had promised to get him a fifth of a kilogram of marijuana 200 grams of unusually good marijuana for $1250 U.S. He had tried to stop smoking marijuana maybe 70 or 80 times before. Before this woman knew him. She did not know he had tried to stop. He always lasted a week or two weeks or maybe two days and then he'd think and decide to have some in his home one more last time. One last final time he'd search out someone new someone he hadn't already told that he had to stop smoking dope and please under no circumstances should they procure him any dope. It had to be a third party because he'd told every dealer he knew to cut him off. And the third party had to be someone all-new because each time he got some he knew this time had to be the last time and so told them asked them as a favor never to get him any more ever. And he never asked a person again once he'd told them this because he was proud and also kind and wouldn't put anyone in that kind of contradictory position. Also he considered himself creepy when it came to dope and he was afraid that others would see that he was creepy about it as well. He sat and thought and waited in an uneven X of light through two different windows. Once or twice he looked at the phone. The insect had disappeared back into the hole in the steel girder a shelf fit into. She'd promised to come at one certain time and it was past that time. Finally he gave in and called her number using just audio and it rang several times and he was afraid of how much time he was taking tying up the line and he got her audio answering device the message had a snatch of ironic pop music and her voice and a male voice together saying we'll call you back and the 'we' made them sound like a couple the man was a handsome black man who was in law school she designed sets and he didn't leave a message because he didn't want her to know how much now he felt like he needed it. He had been very casual about the whole thing. She said she knew a guy just over the river in Allston who sold high-resin dope in moderate bulk and he'd yawned and said well maybe well hey why not sure special occasion I haven't bought any in I don't know how long. She said he lived in a trailer and had a harelip and kept snakes and had no phone and was basically just not what you'd call a pleasant or attractive person at all but the guy in Allston frequently sold dope to theater people in Cambridge and had a devoted following. He said he was trying to even remember when was the last time he'd bought any it had been so long. He said he guessed he'd have her get a decent amount he said he'd had some friends call him in the recent past and ask if he could get them some. He had this thing where he'd frequently say he was getting dope mostly for friends. Then if the woman didn't have it when she said she'd have it for him and he became anxious about it he could tell the woman that it was his friends who were becoming anxious and he was sorry to bother the woman about something so casual but his friends were anxious and bothering him about it and he just wanted to know what he could maybe tell them. He was caught in the middle is how he would represent it. He could say his friends had given him their money and were now anxious and exerting pressure calling and bothering him. This tactic was not possible with this woman who'd said she'd come with it because he hadn't yet given her the $1250. She would not let him. She was well off. Her family was well off she'd said to explain how her condominium was as nice as it was when she worked designing sets for a Cambridge theater company that seemed to do only German plays dark smeary sets. She didn't care much about the money she said she'd cover the cost herself when she got out to the Allston Spur to see whether the guy was at home in the trailer as she was certain he would be this particular afternoon and he could just reimburse her when she brought it to him. This arrangement very casual made him anxious so he'd been even more casual and said sure fine whatever. Thinking back he was sure he'd said whatever which in retrospect worried him because it might have sounded as if he didn't care at all not at all so little that it wouldn't matter if she forgot to get it or call and once he'd made the decision to have marijuana in his home one more time it mattered a lot. It mattered a lot. He'd been too casual with the woman he should have made her take $1250 from him up front claiming politeness claiming he didn't want to inconvenience her financially over something so trivial and casual. Money created a sense of obligation and he should have wanted the woman to feel obliged to do what she'd said once what she'd said she'd do had set him off inside. Once he'd been set off inside it mattered so much that he was somehow afraid to show how much it mattered. Once he had asked her to get it he was committed to several courses of action. The insect on the shelf was back. It didn't seem to do anything. It just came out of the hole in the girder onto the edge of the steel shelf and sat there. After a while it would disappear back into the hole in the girder and he was pretty sure it didn't do anything in there either. He felt similar to the insect inside the girder his shelf was connected to but was not sure just how he was similar. Once he'd decided to own marijuana one more last time he was committed to several courses of action. He had to modem in to the agency and say that there was an emergency and that he was posting an e-note on a colleague's TP asking her to cover his calls for the rest of the week because he'd be out of contact for several days due to this emergency. He had to put an audio message on his answering device saying that starting that afternoon he was going to be unreachable for several days. He had to clean his bedroom because once he had dope he would not leave his bedroom except to go to the refrigerator and the bathroom and even then the trips would be very quick. He had to throw out all his beer and liquor because if he drank alcohol and smoked dope at the same time he would get dizzy and ill and if he had alcohol in the house he could not be relied on not to drink it once he started smoking dope. He'd had to do some shopping. He'd had to lay in supplies. Now just one of the insect's antennae was protruding from the hole in the girder. It protruded but it did not move. He had had to buy soda Oreos bread sandwich meat mayonnaise tomatoes M&M's Almost Home cookies ice cream a Pepperidge Farm frozen chocolate cake and four cans of canned chocolate frosting to be eaten with a large spoon. He'd had to log an order to rent film cartridges from the Inter-Lace entertainment outlet. He'd had to buy antacids for the discomfort that eating all he would eat would cause him late at night. He'd had to buy a new bong because each time he finished what simply had to be his last bulk-quantity of marijuana he decided that that was it he was through he didn't even like it anymore this was it no more hiding no more imposing on his colleagues and putting different messages on his answering device and moving his car away from his condominium and closing his windows and curtains and blinds and living in quick vectors between his bedroom's InterLace teleputer's films and his refrigerator and his toilet and he would take the bong he'd used and throw it away wrapped in several plastic shopping bags. His refrigerator made its own ice in little cloudy crescent blocks and he loved it when he had dope in his home he always drank a great deal of cold soda and ice water. His tongue almost swelled at just the thought. He looked at the phone and the clock. He looked at the windows but not at the foliage and blacktop driveway beyond the windows. He had already vacuumed his Venetian blinds and curtains everything was ready to be shut down. Once the woman who said she'd come had come he would shut the whole system down. It occurred to him that he would disappear into a hole in a girder inside him that supported something else inside him. He was unsure what the thing inside him was and was unprepared to commit himself to the course of action that would be required to explore the question. It was now almost three hours past the time when the woman had said she would come. A counselor Randi with an i with a mustache like a Mountie had told him in the outpatient treatment program he'd gone through two years ago that he seemed insufficiently committed to the course of action that would be required to remove substances from his lifestyle. He'd had to buy a new bong at Bogart's in Porter Square Cambridge because whenever he finished the last of the substances on hand he always threw out all his bongs and pipes screens and tubes and rolling papers and roach clips lighters and Visine and Pepto-Bismol and cookies and frosting to eliminate all future temptation. He always felt a sense of optimism and firm resolve after he'd discarded the materials. He'd bought the new bong and laid in fresh supplies this morning getting back home with everything well before the woman had said she would come. He thought of the new bong and new little packet of round brass screens in the Bogart's bag on his kitchen table in the sunlit kitchen and could not remember what color this new bong was. The last one had been orange the one before that a dusky rose color that had turned muddy at the bottom from resin in just four days. He could not remember the color of this new last and final bong. He considered getting up to check the color of the bong he'd be using but decided that obsessive checking and convulsive movements could compromise the atmosphere of casual calm he needed to maintain while he waited protruding but not moving for the woman he'd met at a design session for his agency's small campaign for her small theater company's new Wedekind festival while he waited for this woman with whom he'd had intercourse twice to honor her casual promise. He tried to decide whether the woman was pretty. Another thing he laid in when he'd committed himself to one last marijuana vacation was petroleum jelly. When he smoked marijuana he tended to masturbate a great deal whether or not there were opportunities for intercourse opting when he smoked for masturbation over intercourse and the petroleum jelly kept him from returning to normal function all tender and sore. He was also hesitant to get up and check the color of his bong because he would have to pass right by the telephone console to get to the kitchen and he didn't want to be tempted to call the woman who'd said she would come again because he felt creepy about bothering her about something he'd represented as so casual and was afraid that several audio hang-ups on her answering device would look even creepier and also he felt anxious about maybe tying up the line at just the moment when she called as she certainly would. He decided to get Call Waiting added to his audio phone service for a nominal extra charge then remembered that since this was positively the last time he would or even could indulge what Randi with an i had called an addiction every bit as rapacious as pure alcoholism there would be no real need for Call Waiting since a situation like the present one could never arise again. This line of thinking almost caused him to become angry. To ensure the composure with which he sat waiting in light in his chair he focused his senses on his surroundings. No part of the insect he'd seen was now visible. The clicks of his portable clock were really composed of three smaller clicks signifying he supposed preparation movement and readjustment. He began to grow disgusted with himself for waiting so anxiously for the promised arrival of something that had stopped being fun anyway. He didn't even know why he liked it anymore. It made his mouth dry and his eyes dry and red and his face sag and he hated it when his face sagged it was as if all the integrity of all the muscles in his face was eroded by marijuana and he got terribly self-conscious about the fact that his face was sagging and had long ago forbidden himself to smoke dope around anyone else. He didn't even know what its draw was anymore. He couldn't even be around anyone else if he'd smoked marijuana that same day it made him so self-conscious. And the dope often gave him a painful case of pleurisy if he smoked it for more than two straight days of heavy continuous smoking in front of the Inter-Lace viewer in his bedroom. It made his thoughts jut out crazily in jagged directions and made him stare raptly like an unbright child at entertainment cartridges — when he laid in film cartridges for a vacation with marijuana he favored cartridges in which a lot of things blew up and crashed into each other which he was sure an unpleasant-fact specialist like Randi would point out had implications that were not good. He pulled his necktie down smooth while he gathered his intellect will self-knowledge and conviction and determined that when this latest woman came as she surely would this would simply be his very last marijuana debauch. He'd simply smoke so much so fast that it would be so unpleasant and the memory of it so repulsive that once he'd consumed it and gotten it out of his home and his life as quickly as possible he would never want to do it again. He would make it his business to create a really bad set of debauched associations with the stuff in his memory. The dope scared him. It made him afraid. It wasn't that he was afraid of the dope it was that smoking it made him afraid of everything else. It had long since stopped being a release or relief or fun. This last time he would smoke the whole 200 grams—120 grams cleaned destemmed — in four days over an ounce a day all in tight heavy economical one-hitters off a quality virgin bong an incredible insane amount per day he'd make it a mission treating it like a penance and behavior-modification regimen all at once he'd smoke his way through thirty high-grade grams a day starting the moment he woke up and used ice water to detach his tongue from the roof of his mouth and took an antacid — averaging out to 200 or 300 heavy bong-hits per day an insane and deliberately unpleasant amount and he'd make it a mission to smoke it continu- ously even though if the marijuana was as good as the woman claimed he'd do five hits and then not want to take the trouble to load and one-hit any more for at least an hour. But he would force himself to do it anyway. He would smoke it all even if he didn't want it. Even if it started to make him dizzy and ill. He would use discipline and persistence and will and make the whole experience so unpleasant so debased and debauched and unpleasant that his behavior would be henceforward modified he'd never even want to do it again because the memory of the insane four days to come would be so firmly terribly emblazoned in his memory. He'd cure himself by excess. He predicted that the woman when she came might want to smoke some of the 200 grams with him hang out hole up listen to some of his impressive collection of Tito Puente recordings and probably have intercourse. He had never once had actual intercourse on marijuana. Frankly the idea repelled him. Two dry mouths bumping at each other trying to kiss his selfconscious thoughts twisting around on themselves like a snake on a stick while he bucked and snorted dryly above her his swollen eyes red and his face sagging so that its slack folds maybe touched limply the folds of her own loose sagging face is it sloshed back and forth on his pillow its mouth working dryly. The thought was repellent. He decided he'd have her toss him what she'd promised to bring and then would from a distance toss back to her the $1250 U.S. in large bills and tell her not to let the door hit her on the butt on the way out. He'd say ass instead of butt. He'd be so rude and unpleasant to her that the memory of his lack of basic decency and of her tight offended face would be a further disincentive ever in the future to risk calling her and repeating the course of action he had now committed himself to. He had never been so anxious for the arrival of a woman he did not want to see. He remembered clearly the last woman he'd involved in his trying just one more vacation with dope and drawn blinds. The last woman had been something called an appropriation artist which seemed to mean that she copied and embellished other art and then sold it through a prestigious Marlborough Street gallery. She had an artistic manifesto that involved radical feminist themes. He'd let her give him one of her smaller paintings which covered half the wall over his bed and was of a famous film actress whose name he always had a hard time recalling and a less famous film actor the two of them entwined in a scene from a well-known old film a romantic scene an embrace copied from a film history textbook and much enlarged and made stilted and with obscenities scrawled all over it in bright red letters. The last woman had been sexy but not pretty as the woman he now didn't want to see but was waiting anxiously for was pretty in a faded withered Cambridge way that made her seem pretty but not sexy. The appropriation artist had been led to believe that he was a former speed addict intravenous addiction to methamphetamine hydrochloride1 is what he remembered telling that one he had even described the awful taste of hydro-chloride in the addict's mouth immediately after injection he had researched the subject carefully. She had been further led to believe that marijuana kept him from using the drug with which he really had a problem and so that if he seemed anxious to get some once she'd offered to get him some it was only because he was heroically holding out against much darker deeper more addictive urges and he needed her to help him. He couldn't quite remember when or how she'd been given all these impressions. He had not sat down and outright bold-faced lied to her it had been more of an impression he'd conveyed and nurtured and allowed to gather its own life and force. The insect was now entirely visible. It was on the shelf that held his digital equalizer. The insect might never actually have retreated all the way back into the hole in the shelf's girder. What looked like its reemergence might just have been a change in his attention or the two windows' light or the visual context of his surroundings. The girder protruded from the wall and was a triangle of dull steel with holes for shelves to fit into. The metal shelves that held his audio equipment were painted a dark industrial green and were originally made for holding canned goods. They were designed to be extra kitchen shelves. The insect sat inside its dark shiny case with an immobility that seemed like the gathering of a force it sat like the hull of a vehicle from which the engine had been for the moment removed. It was dark and had a shiny case and antennae that protruded but did not move. He had to use the bathroom. His last piece of contact from the appropriation artist with whom he had had intercourse and who during intercourse had sprayed some sort of perfume up into the air from a mister she held in her left hand as she lay beneath him making a wide variety of sounds and spraying perfume up into the air so that he felt the cold mist of it settling on his back and shoulders and was chilled and repelled his last piece of contact after he'd gone into hiding with the marijuana she'd gotten for him had been a card she'd mailed that was a pastiche photo of a doormat of coarse green plastic grass with WELCOME on it and next to it a flattering publicity photo of the appropriation artist from her Back Bay gallery and between them an unequal sign which was an equal sign with a diagonal slash across it and also an obscenity he had assumed was directed at him magisculed in red grease pencil along the bottom with multiple exclamation points. She had been offended because he had seen her every day for ten days then when she'd finally obtained 50 grams of genetically enhanced hydroponic marijuana for him he had said that she'd saved his life and he was grateful and the friends for whom he'd promised to get some were grateful and she had to go right now because he had an appointment and had to take off but that he would doubtless be calling her later that day and they had shared a moist kiss and she had said she could feel his heart pounding right through his suit coat and she had driven away in her rusty unmuffled car and he had gone and moved his own car to an underground garage several blocks away and had run back and drawn the clean blinds and curtains and changed the audio message on his answering device to one that described an emergency departure from town and had drawn and locked his bedroom blinds and had taken the new rose-colored bong out of its Bogart's bag and was not seen for three days and ignored over two dozen audio messages and protocols and e-notes expressing concern over his message's emergency and had never contacted her again. He had hoped she would assume he had succumbed again to methamphetamine hydrochloride and was sparing her the agony of his descent back into the hell of chemical dependence. What it really was was that he had again decided those 50 grams of resin-soaked dope which had been so potent that on the second day it had given him an anxiety attack so paralyzing that he had gone to the bathroom in a Tufts University commemorative ceramic stein to avoid leaving his bedroom represented his very last debauch ever with dope and that he had to cut himself off from all possible future sources of temptation and supply and this surely included the appropriation artist who had come with the stuff at precisely the time she'd promised he recalled. From the street outside came the sound of a dumpster being emptied into an E.W.D. land barge. His shame at what she might on the other hand perceive as his slimy phallocentric conduct toward her made it easier for him to avoid her as well. Though not shame really. More like being uncomfortable at the thought of it. He had had to launder his bedding twice to get the smell of the perfume out. He went into the bathroom to use the bathroom making it a point to look neither at the insect visible on the shelf to his left nor at the telephone console on its lacquer workstation to the right. He was committed to touching neither. Where was the woman who had said she'd come. The new bong in the Bogart's bag was orange meaning he might have misremembered the bong before it as orange. It was a rich autumnal orange that lightened to more of a citrus orange when its plastic cylinder was held up to the late-afternoon light of the window over the kitchen sink. The metal of its stem and bowl was rough stainless steel the kind with a grain unpretty and all business. The bong was half a meter tall and had a weighted base covered in soft false suede. Its orange plastic was thick and the carb on the side opposite the stem had been raggedly cut so that rough shards of plastic protruded from the little hole and might well hurt his thumb when he smoked which he decided to consider just part of the penance he would undertake after the woman had come and gone. He left the door to the bathroom open so that he would be sure to hear the telephone when it sounded or the buzzer to the front doors of his condominium complex when it sounded. In the bathroom his throat suddenly closed and he wept hard for two or three seconds before the weeping stopped abruptly and he could not get it to start again. It was now over four hours since the time the woman had casually committed to come. Was he in the bathroom or in his chair near the window and near his telephone console and the insect and the window that had admitted a straight rectangular bar of light when he began to wait. The light through this window was coming at an angle more and more oblique. Its shadow had become a parallelogram. The light through the southwest window was straight and reddening. He had thought he needed to use the bathroom but was unable to. He tried putting a whole stack of film cartridges into the dock of the disc-drive and then turning on the huge teleputer in his bedroom. He could see the piece of appropriation art in the mirror above the TP. He lowered the volume all the way and pointed the remote device at the TP like some sort of weapon. He sat on the edge of his bed with his elbows on his knees and scanned the stack of cartridges. Each cartridge in the dock dropped on command and began to engage the drive with an insectile click and whir and he scanned it. But he was unable to distract himself with the TP because he was unable to stay with any one entertainment cartridge for more than a few seconds. The moment he recognized what exactly was on one cartridge he had a strong anxious feeling that there was something more entertaining on another cartridge and that he was potentially missing it. He realized that he would have plenty of time to enjoy all the cartridges and realized intellectually that the feeling of deprived panic over missing something made no sense. The viewer hung on the wall half again as large as the piece of feminist art. He scanned cartridges for some time. The telephone console sounded during this interval of anxious scanning. He was up and moving back out toward it before the first ring was completed flooded with either excitement or relief the TP's remote device still in his hand but it was only a friend and colleague calling and when he heard the voice that was not the woman who had promised to bring what he'd committed the next several days to banishing from his life forever he was almost sick with disappointment with a great deal of mistaken adrenaline now shining and ringing in his system and he got off the line with the colleague to clear the line and keep it available for the woman so fast that he was sure his colleague perceived him as either angry with him or just plain rude. He was further upset at the thought that his answering the telephone this late in the day did not jibe with the emergency message about being unreachable that would be on his answering device if the colleague called back after the woman had come and gone and he'd shut the whole system of his life down and he was standing over the telephone console trying to decide whether the risk of the colleague or someone else from the agency calling back was sufficient to justify changing the audio message on the answering device to describe an emergency departure this evening instead of this afternoon but he decided he felt that since the woman had definitely committed to coming his leaving the message unchanged would be a gesture of fidelity to her commitment and might somehow in some oblique way strengthen that commitment. The E.W.D. land barge was emptying dumpsters all up and down the street. He returned to his chair near the window. The disk drive and TP viewer were still on in his bedroom and he could see through the angle of the bedroom's doorway the lights from the high-definition screen blink and shift from one primary color to another in the dim room and for a while he killed time casually by trying to imagine what entertaining scenes on the unwatched viewer the changing colors and intensities might signify. The chair faced the room instead of the window. Reading while waiting for marijuana was out of the question. He considered masturbating but did not. He didn't reject the idea so much as not react to it and watch as it floated away. He thought very broadly of desires and ideas being watched but not acted upon he thought of impulses being starved of expression and drying out and floating dryly away and felt on some level that this had something to do with him and his circumstances and what if this grueling final debauch he'd committed himself to didn't somehow resolve the problem would surely have to be called his problem but he could not even begin to try to see how the image of desiccated impulses floating dryly related to either him or the insect which had retreated back into its hole in the angled girder because at this precise time his telephone and his intercom to the front door's buzzer both sounded at the same time both loud and tortured and so abrupt they sounded yanked through a very small hole into the great balloon of colored silence he sat in waiting and he moved first toward the telephone console then over toward his intercom module then convulsively back toward the sounding phone and then tried somehow to move toward both at once finally so that he stood splay-legged arms wildly out as if something's been flung splayed entombed between the two sounds without a thought in his head. 1 APRIL — YEAR OF THE TUCKS MEDICATED PAD 'All I know is my dad said to come here.’ 'Come right in.

This holds true regardless of whether the fathers are still alive. Because he left his dormitory room before 0600 for dawn drills and often didn't get back there until after supper packing his book bag and knapsack and gear bag for the whole day together with selecting his best-strung racquets — it all took Hal some time. Plus he usually collected and packed and selected in the dark and with stealth because his brother Mario was usually still asleep in the other bed. Mario didn't drill and couldn't play and needed all the sleep he could get. Hal held his complimentary gear bag and was putting different pairs of sweats to his face trying to find the cleanest pair by smell when the telephone console sounded. Mario thrashed and sat up in bed a small hunched shape with a big head against the gray light of the window. Hal got to the console on the second ring and had the transparent phone's antenna out by the third. His way of answering the phone sounded like 'Mmmyellow.’ 'I want to tell you' the voice on the phone said. 'My head is filled with things to say.’ Hal held three pairs of E.T.A. sweatpants in the hand that didn't hold the phone. He saw his older brother succumb to gravity and fall back limp against the pillows. Mario often sat up and fell back still asleep. 'I don't mind' Hal said softly. 'I could wait forever.’ 'That's what you think' the voice said. The connection was cut. It had been Orin. 'Hey Hal?’ The light in the room was a creepy gray a kind of nonlight. Hal could hear Brandt laughing at something Kenkle had said off down the hall and the clank of their janitorial buckets. The person on the phone had been O. 'Hey Hal?' Mario was awake. It took four pillows to support Mario's oversized skull. His voice came from the tangled bedding. 'Is it still dark out or is it me?’ 'Go back to sleep. It isn't even six.' Hal put the good leg into the sweatpants first. 'Who was it?’ Shoving three coverless Dunlop widebodies into the gear bag and zipping the bag partway up so the handles had room to stick out. Carrying all three bags back over to the console to deactivate the ringer on the phone. He said 'No one you know I don't think.’ YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT Though only one-half ethnic Arab and a Canadian by birth and residence the medical attache is nevertheless once again under Saudi diplomatic immunity this time as special ear-nose-throat consultant to the personal physician of Prince Q--------- the Saudi Minister of Home Entertainment here on northeastern U.S.A. soil with his legation to cut another mammoth deal with InterLace TelEntertainment. The medical attache turns thirty-seven tomorrow Thursday 2 April in the North American lunar Y.D.A.U. The legation finds the promotional subsidy of the North American calendar hilariously vulgar. To say nothing of the arresting image of the idolatrous West's most famous and self-congratulating idol the colossal Libertine Statue wearing some type of enormous adult-design diaper a hilariously apposite image popular in the news photos of so many international journals. The attache's medical practice being normally divided between Montreal and the Rub' al Khali it is his first trip back to U.S.A. soil since completing his residency eight years ago. His duties here involve migrating with the Prince and his retinue between InterLace's two hubs of manufacture and dissemination in Phoenix Arizona U.S.A. and Boston Massachusetts U.S.A. respectively offering expert E.N.T. assistance to the personal physician of Prince Q---------. The medical attache's particular expertise is the maxillofacial consequences of imbalances in intestinal flora. Prince Q---------(as would anyone who refuses to eat pretty much anything but Töblerone) suffers chronically from Candida albicans with attendant susceptibilities to monilial sinusitis and thrush the yeasty sores and sinal im-pactions of which require almost daily drainage in the cold and damp of early-spring Boston U.S.A. A veritable artist possessed of a deftness nonpareil with cotton swab and evacuation-hypo the medical attache is known among the shrinking upper classes of petro-Arab nations as the DeBakey of maxillofacial yeast his staggering fee-scale as wholly ad valorem. Saudi consulting fees in particular are somewhere just past obscene but the medical attache's duties on this trip are personally draining and sort of nauseous and when he arrives back at the sumptuous apartments he had his wife sublet in districts far from the legation's normal Back Bay and Scotts-dale digs at the day's end he needs unwinding in the very worst way. A more than averagely devout follower of the North American sufism promulgated in his childhood by Pir Valayat the medical attache partakes of neither kif nor distilled spirits and must unwind without chemical aid. When he arrives home after evening prayers he wants to look upon a spicy and 100% shari'a-halal dinner piping hot and arranged and steaming pleasantly on its attachable tray he wants his bib ironed and laid out by the tray at the ready and he wants the living room's teleputer booted and warmed up and the evening's entertainment cartridges already selected and arranged and lined up in dock ready for remote insertion into the viewer's drive. He reclines before the viewer in his special electronic recliner and his black-veiled ethnically Arab wife wordlessly attends him loosening any constric-tive clothing adjusting the room's lighting fitting the complexly molded dinner tray over his head so that his shoulders support the tray and allow it to project into space just below his chin that he may enjoy his hot dinner without having to remove his eyes from whatever entertainment is up and playing. He has a narrow imperial-style beard which his wife also attends and keeps free of detritus from the tray just below. The medical attache sits and watches and eats and watches unwinding by visible degrees until the angles of his body in the chair and his head on his neck indicate that he has passed into sleep at which point his special electronic recliner can be made automatically to recline to full horizontal and luxuriant silk-analog bedding emerges flowingly from long slots in the appliance's sides; and unless his wife is inconsiderate and clumsy with the recliner's remote hand-held controls the medical attache is permitted to ease effortlessly from unwound spectation into a fully relaxed night's sleep still right there in the recumbent recliner the TP set to run a recursive loop of lowvolume surf and light rain on broad green leaves. Except that is for Wednesday nights which in Boston are permitted to be his wife's Arab Women's Advanced League tennis night with the other legation wives and companions at the plush Mount Auburn Club in West Watertown on which nights she is not around wordlessly to attend him since Wednesday is the U.S.A. weekday on which fresh Töblerone hits Boston Massachusetts U.S.A.'s Newbury Street's import-confectioners' shelves and the Saudi Minister of Home Entertainment's inability to control his appetites for Wednesday Töblerone often requires the medical attache to remain in personal attendance all evening on the bulk-rented fourteenth floor of the Back Bay Hilton juggling tongue-depressors and cotton swabs nystatin and ibuprofen and stiptics and antibiotic thrush salves rehabilitating the mucous membranes of the dyspeptic and distressed and often (but not always) penitent and appreciative Saudi Prince Q---------. So on 1 April Y.D.A.U. when the medical attache is (it is alleged) insufficiently deft with a Q-Tip on an ulcerated sinal necrosis and is subjected at just 1800h. to a fit of febrile thrushive pique from the florally imbalanced Minister of Home Entertainment and is by high-volume fiat replaced at the royal bedside by the Prince's personal physician who's summoned by beeper from the Hilton's sauna and when the damp personal physician pats the medical attache on the shoulder and tells him to pay the pique no mind that it's just the yeast talking but to just head on home and unwind and for once make a well-deserved early Wednesday evening of it and but so when the attache does get home at like 1840h. his spacious Boston apartments are empty the living room lights undimmed dinner unheated and the attachable tray still in the dishwasher and — worst — of course no entertainment cartridges have been obtained from the Boylston St. InterLace outlet where the medical attache's wife like all the veiled wives and companions of the Prince's legatees has a complimentary goodwill account. And even if he weren't far too exhausted and tightly wound to venture back into the damp urban night to pick up entertainment cartridges the medical attache realizes that his wife has as always on Wednesdays taken the car with the diplomatic-immunity license plates without which your thinking alien wouldn't even dream of trying to park publicly at night in Boston Massachusetts U.S.A. The medical attache's unwinding-options are thus severely constricted. The living room's lavish TP receives also the spontaneous disseminations of the InterLace Subscription Pulse-Matrix but the procedures for ordering specific spontaneous pulses from the service are so technologically and cryp-tographically complex that the attache has always left the whole business to his wife. On this Wednesday night trying buttons and abbreviations almost at random the attache is able to summon up only live U.S.A. professional sports — which he has always found brutish and repellent — Texaco Oil Company-sponsored opera — which the attache has seen today more than enough of the human uvula thank you very much — a redisseminated episode of the popular afternoon InterLace children's program 'Mr. Bouncety-Bounce' — which the attache thinks for a moment might be a documentary on bipolar mood disorders until he catches on and thumbs the selection-panel hastily — and a redisseminated session of the scantily clad variable-impact early-A.M. 'Fit Forever' home-aerobics series of the InterLace aerobics-guru Ms. Tawni Kondo the scantily clad and splay-limbed immodesty of which threatens the devout medical attache with the possibility of impure thoughts. The only entertainment cartridges anywhere in the apartment a foul-tempered search reveals are those which have arrived in Wednesday's U.S.A. postal delivery left on the sideboard in the living room along with personal and professional faxes and mail the medical attache declines to read until it's been pre-scanned by his wife for relevant interest to himself. The sideboard is against the wall opposite the room's electronic recliner under a triptych of high-quality Byzantine erotica. The padded cartridge-mailers with their distinctive rectangular bulge are mixed haphazardly in with the less entertaining mail. Searching for something to unwind with the medical attache tears the different padded mailers open along their designated perforations. There is an O.N.A.N.M.A. Specialty Service film on actinomycete-class antibiotics and irritable bowel syndrome. There is 1 April Y.D. A.U.'s CBC/PATHÉ North American News Summary 40-minute cartridge available daily by a wife's autosubscription and either transmitted to TP by unrecordable InterLace pulse or express-posted on a single-play ROM self-erasing disk. There is the Arabic-language video edition of April's Self magazine for the attache's wife Nass's cover's model chastely swathed and veiled. There is a plain brown and irritatingly untitled cartridge-case in a featureless white three-day standard U.S.A. First Class padded cartridge-mailer. The padded mailer is postmarked suburban Phoenix area in Arizona U.S.A. and the returnaddress box has only the term 'HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!' with a small drawn crude face smiling in ballpoint ink instead of a return address or incorporated logo. Though by birth and residence a native of Quebec where the language of discourse is not English the medical attache knows quite well that the English word anniversary does not mean the same as birthday. And the medical attache and his veiled wife were united in the eyes of God and Prophet not in April but in October four years prior in the Rub'al Khali. Adding to the padded mailer's confusion is the fact that anything from Prince Q---------'s legation in Phoenix Arizona U.S.A. would carry a diplomatic seal instead of routine O.N.A.N. postage. The medical attache in sum feels tightly wound and badly underappreciated and is prepared in advance to be irritated by the item inside which is merely a standard black entertainment cartridge but is wholly unlabelled and not in any sort of colorful or informative or inviting cartridge-case and has only another of these vapid U.S.A.-type circular smiling heads embossed upon it where the registration- and duration-codes are supposed to be embossed. The medical attache is puzzled by the cryptic mailer and face and case and unlabelled entertainment and preliminarily irritated by the amount of time he's had to spend upright at the sideboard attending to mail which is not his task. The sole reason he does not throw the unlabelled cartridge in the wastecan or put it aside for his wife to preview for relevance is because there are such woefully slim entertainment-pickings on his wife's irritating Americanized tennis-league evening away from her place at home. The attache will pop the cartridge in and scan just enough of its contents to determine whether it is irritating or of an irrelevant nature and not entertaining or engaging in any way. He will heat the prepared halal lamb and spicy halal garnish in the microwave oven until piping-hot arrange it attractively on his tray preview the first few moments of the puzzling and/or irritating or possibly mysteriously blank entertainment cartridge first then unwind with the news summary then perhaps have a quick unlibidinous look at Nðss's spring line of sexless black devout-women's-wear then will insert the recursive surf-and-rain cartridge and make a well-deserved early Wednesday evening of it hoping only that his wife will not return from her tennis league in her perspiration-dampened black ankle-length tennis ensemble and remove his dinner tray from his sleeping neck in a clumsy or undeft fashion that will awaken him potentially. When he settles in with the tray and cartridge the TP's viewer's digital display reads 1927h. YEAR OF THE TRIAL-SIZE DOVE BAR Wardine say her momma aint treat her right.

And I am gone have a child. In the eighth American-educational grade Bruce Green fell dreadfully in love with a classmate who had the unlikely name of Mildred Bonk. The name was unlikely because if ever an eighth-grader looked like a Daphne Christianson or a Kimberly St.- Simone or something like that it was Mildred Bonk. She was the kind of fatally pretty and nubile wraithlike figure who glides through the sweaty junior-high corridors of every nocturnal emitter's dreamscape. Hair that Green had heard described by an overwrought teacher as 'flaxen'; a body which the fickle angel of puberty — the same angel who didn't even seem to know Bruce Green's zip code — had visited kissed and already left back in sixth; legs which not even orange Keds with purple-glitterencrusted laces could make unserious. Shy iridescent coltish pelvically anfractuous amply busted given to diffident movements of hand brushing flaxen hair from front of dear creamy forehead movements which drove Bruce Green up a private tree. A vision in a sundress and silly shoes. Mildred L. Bonk. And then but by tenth grade in one of those queer when-did-that-happen metamorphoses Mildred Bonk had become an imposing member of the frightening Winchester High School set that smoked full-strength Marl-boros in the alley between Senior and Junior halls and that left school altogether at lunchtime driving away in loud low-slung cars to drink beer and smoke dope driving around with sound-systems of illegal wattage using Visine and Clorets etc. She was one of them. She chewed gum (or worse) in the cafeteria her dear diffident face now a bored mask of Attitude her flaxen locks now teased and gelled into what looked for all the world like the consequence of a finger stuck into an electric socket. Bruce Green saved up for a low-slung old car and practiced Attitude on the aunt who'd taken him in. He developed a will. And by the year of what would have been graduation Bruce Green was way more bored imposing and frightening than even Mildred Bonk and he and Mildred Bonk and tiny incontinent Harriet Bonk-Green lived just off the Allston Spur in a shiny housetrailer with another frightening couple and with Tommy Doocey the infamous harelipped pot-and-sundries dealer who kept several large snakes in unclean uncovered aquaria which smelled which Tommy Doocey didn't notice because his upper lip completely covered his nostrils and all he could smell was lip. Mildred Bonk got high in the afternoon and watched serialcartridges and Bruce Green had a steady job at Leisure Time Ice and for a while life was more or less one big party. YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT 'Hal?’ '...’ ...Hey Hal?’ 'Yes Mario?’ 'Are you asleep?’ 'Booboo we've been over this.

When he hit that one down the line and you got it and fell down and hit that drop-volley Pemulis said the guy looked like he was going to be sick all over the net he said.’ 'Boo I kicked a kid's ass is all. End of story. I don't think it's good to rehash it when I've kicked somebody's ass. It's like a dignity thing. I think we should just let it sort of lie in state quietly. Speaking of which.’ 'Hey Hal?’ '...’ 'Hey Hal?’ 'It's late Mario. It's sleepy-time. Close your eyes and think fuzzy thoughts.’ 'That's what the Moms always says too.’ 'Always worked for me Boo.’ 'You think I think fuzzy thoughts all the time.

I just did.’ 'I just didn't happen to say what you wanted to hear Booboo is all.’ '...’ 'There's a difference.’ 'I don't get how you couldn't feel like you believed today out there. It was so right there. You moved like you totally believed.’ '...’ 'How do you feel inside not?’ 'Mario you and I are mysterious to each other.

They don't seem as sunk in. They look better. She laughs at C.T. way more than she laughed at Himself. She laughs from lower down inside. She laughs more. Her jokes she tells are better ones than yours even now a lot of the time.’ '...’ 'How come she never got sad?’ 'She did get sad Booboo. She just got sad in her way instead of yours and mine. She got sad I'm pretty sure.’ 'Hal?’ 'You remember how the staff lowered the flag to half-mast out front by the portcullis here after it happened? Do you remember that? And it goes to half-mast every year at Convocation? Remember the flag Boo?’ 'Hey Hal?’ 'Don't cry Booboo. Remember the flag only halfway up the pole?

So listen — one way to lower the flag to half-mast is just to lower the flag. There's another way though. You can also just raise the pole. You can raise the pole to like twice its original height. You get me? You understand what I mean Mario?’ 'Hal?’ 'She's plenty sad I bet.’ At 2OlOh. on 1 April Y.D.A.U. the medical attache is still watching the unlabelled entertainment cartridge. OCTOBER — YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT For Orin Incandenza # morning is the soul's night. The day's worst time psychically. He cranks the condo's AC way down at night and still most mornings wakes up soaked fetally curled entombed in that kind of psychic darkness where you're dreading whatever you think of. Hal Incandenza's brother Orin wakes up alone at 0730h. amid a damp scent of Ambush and on the other side's dented pillow a note with phone # and vital data in a loopy schoolgirlish hand. There's also Ambush on the note. His side of the bed is soaked. Orin makes honey-toast standing barefoot at the kitchen counter wearing briefs and an old Academy sweatshirt with the arms cut off squeezing honey from the head of a plastic bear. The floor's so cold it hurts his feet but the double-pane window over the sink is hot to the touch: the beastly metro Phoenix October A.M. heat just outside. Home with the team no matter how high the AC or how thin the sheet Orin wakes with his own impression sweated darkly into the bed beneath him slowly drying all day to a white salty outline just slightly off from the week's other faint dried outlines so his fetal-shaped fossilized image is fanned out across his side of the bed like a deck of cards just overlapping like an acid trail or timed exposure. The heat just past the glass doors tightens his scalp. He takes breakfast out to a white iron table by the condo complex's central pool and tries to eat it there in the heat the coffee not steaming or cooling. He sits there in dumb animal pain. He has a mustache of sweat. A bright beach ball floats and bumps against one side of the pool. The sun like a sneaky keyhole view of hell. No one else out here. The complex is a ring with the pool and deck and Jacuzzi in the center. Heat shimmers off the deck like fumes from fuel. There's that mirage thing where the extreme heat makes the dry deck look wet with fuel. Orin can hear cartridgeviewers going from behind closed windows that aerobics show every morning and also someone playing an organ and the older woman who won't ever smile back at him in the apartment next to his doing operatic scales muffled by drapes and sun-curtains and double panes. The Jacuzzi chugs and foams. The note from last night's Subject is on violet bond once folded and with a circle of darker violet dead-center where the subject's perfume-spritzer had hit it. The only interesting thing about the script but also depressing is that every single circle — o's d's p's the #s 6 and 8 — is darkened in while the i's are dotted not with circles but with tiny little Valentine hearts which are not darkened in. Orin reads the note while he eats toast that's mainly an excuse for the honey. He uses his smaller right arm to eat and drink. His oversized left arm and big left leg remain at rest at all times in the morning. A breeze sends the beach ball skating all the way across the blue pool to the other side and Orin watches its noiseless glide. The white iron tables have no umbrellas and you can tell where the sun is without looking; you can feel right where it is on your body and project from there. The ball moves tentatively back out toward the middle of the pool and then stays there not even bobbing. The same small breezes make the rotted palms along the condominium complex's stone walls rustle and click and a couple of fronds detach and spiral down hitting the deck with a slap. All the plants out here are malevolent heavy and sharp. The parts of the palms above the fronds are tufted in sick stuff like coconut-hair. Roaches and other things live in the trees. Rats maybe. Loathsome high-altitude critters of all kinds. All the plants either spiny or meaty. Cacti in queer tortured shapes. The tops of the palms like Rod Stewart's hair from days gone by. Orin returned with the team from the Chicago game two nights ago redeye. He knows that he and the place-kicker are the only two starters who are not still in terrible pain physically from the beating. The day before they left — so like five days ago — Orin was out by himself in the Jacuzzi by the pool late in the day caring for the leg sitting in the radiant heat and bloody late-day light with the leg in the Jacuzzi absently squeezing the tennis ball he still absently squeezes out of habit. Watching the Jacuzzi funnel and bubble and foam around the leg. And out of nowhere a bird had all of a sudden fallen into the Jacuzzi. With a flat matter-of-fact plop. Out of nowhere. Out of the wide empty sky. Nothing overhung the Jacuzzi but sky. The bird seemed to have just had a coronary or something in flight and died and fallen out of the empty sky and landed dead in the Jacuzzi right by the leg. He brought his sunglasses down onto the bridge of his nose with a finger and looked at it. It was an undistinguished kind of bird. Not a predator. Like a wren maybe. It seems like no way could it have been a good sign. The dead bird bobbed and barrel-rolled in the foam sucked under one second and reappearing the next creating an illusion of continued flight. Orin had inherited none of the Moms's phobias about disorder hygiene. (Not crazy about bugs though — roaches.) But he'd just sat there squeezing the ball looking at the bird without a conscious thought in his head. By the next morning waking up curled and entombed it seemed like it had to have been a bad sign though. Orin now always gets the shower so hot it's to where he can just barely stand it. The condo's whole bathroom is done in this kind of minty yellow tile he didn't choose maybe chosen by the free safety who lived here before the Cardinals sent New Orleans the free safety two reserve guards and cash for Orin Incandenza punter. And no matter how many times he has the Terminex people out there are still the enormous roaches that come out of the bathroom drains. Sewer roaches according to Terminex. Blattaria implacablus or something. Really huge roaches. Armoredvehicle-type bugs. Totally black with Kevlar-type cases the works. And fearless raised in the Hobbesian sewers down there. Boston's and New Orleans's little brown roaches were bad enough but you could at least come in and turn on a light and they'd run for their lives. These Southwest sewer roaches you turn on the light and they just look up at you from the tile like: 'You got a problem?' Orin stomped on one of them only once that had come hellishly up out of the drain in the shower when he was in there showering going out naked and putting shoes on and coming in and trying to conventionally squash it and the result was explosive. There's still material from that one time in the tile-grouting. It seems unremovable. Roach-innards. Sickening. Throwing the shoes away was preferable to looking at the sole to clean it. Now he keeps big glass tumblers in the bathroom and when he turns on the light and sees a roach he puts a glass down over it trapping it. After a couple days the glass is all steamed up and the roach has asphyxiated messlessly and Orin discards both the roach and the tumbler in separate sealed Ziplocs in the dumpster complex by the golf course up the street. The yellow tile floor of the bathroom is sometimes a little obstacle course of glasses with huge roaches dying inside stoically just sitting there the glasses gradually steaming up with roach-dioxide. The whole thing makes Orin sick. Now he figures the hotter the shower's water the less chance any small armored vehicle is going to feel like coming out of the drain while he's in there. Sometimes they're in the bowl of the toilet first thing in the A.M. dog-paddling trying to get to the side and climb up. He's also not crazy about spiders though more like unconsciously; he's never come anyplace close to the conscious horror Himself had somehow developed about the South-west's black widows and their chaotic webs — the widows are all over the place both here and Tucson spottable on all but the coldest nights their dusty webs without any kind of pattern clotting just about any rightangled place that's dim or out of the way. Terminex's toxins are more effective on the widows. Orin has them out monthly; he's on like a subscription plan over at Terminex. Orin's special conscious horror besides heights and the early morning is roaches. There'd been parts of metro Boston near the Bay he'd refused to go to as a child. Roaches give him the howling fantods. The parishes around N.O. had been having a spate or outbreak of a certain Latin-origin breed of sinister tropical flying roaches that were small and timid but could fucking fly and that kept being found swarming on New Orleans infants at night in their cribs especially infants in like tenements or squalor and that reportedly fed on the mucus in the babies' eyes some special sort of optical-mucus — the stuff of fucking nightmares mobile flying roaches that wanted to get at your eyes as an infant — and were reportedly blinding them; par-ents'd come in in the ghastly A.M.-tenement light and find their infants blind like a dozen blinded infants that last summer; and it was during this spate or nightmarish outbreak plus July flooding that sent over a dozen nightmarish dead bodies from a hilltop graveyard sliding all grayblue down the incline Orin and two teammates had their townhouse on in suburban Chalmette shedding limbs and innards all the way down the hillside's mud and one even one morning coming to rest against the post of their roadside mailbox when Orin came out for the morning paper that Orin had had his agent put out the trade feelers. And so to the glass canyons and merciless light of metro Phoenix in a kind of desiccated circle near the Tucson of his own father's desiccated youth. It's the mornings after the spider-and-heights dreams that are the most painful that it takes sometimes three coffees and two showers and sometimes a run to loosen the grip on his soul's throat; and these post-dream mornings are even worse if he wakes unalone if the previous night's Subject is still there wanting to twitter or to cuddle and like spoon asking what exactly is the story with the foggy inverted tumblers on the bathroom floor commenting on his night-sweats clattering around in the kitchen making kippers or bacon or something even more hideous and unhoneyed he's supposed to eat with post-coital male gusto the ones who have this thing about they call it Feeding My Man wanting a man who can barely keep down A.M. honey-toast to eat with male gusto elbows out and shovelling making little noises. Even when alone able to uncurl alone and sit slowly up and wring out the sheet and go to the bathroom these darkest mornings start days that Orin can't even bring himself for hours to think about how he'll get through the day. These worst mornings with cold floors and hot windows and merciless light — the soul's certainty that the day will have to be not traversed but sort of climbed vertically and then that going to sleep again at the end of it will be like falling again off something tall and sheer. So now his own eye-mucus is secure in the Desert Southwest; but the bad dreams have gotten worse since the trade to this blasted area Himself himself had fled long ago as an unhappy youngster. As a nod to Orin's own unhappy youth all the dreams seem to open briefly with some sort of competitive-tennis situation. Last night's had started with a wide-angle shot of Orin on a Har-Tru court waiting to receive serve from someone vague some Academy person — Ross Reat maybe or good old M. Bain or gray-toothed Walt Flechette now a teaching pro in the Carolinas — when the dream's screen tightens on him and abruptly dissolves to the blank dark rose color of eyes closed against bright light and there's the ghastly feeling of being submerged and not knowing which way to head for the surface and air and after some interval the dream's Orin struggles up from this kind of visual suffocation to find his mother's head Mrs. Avril M. T. Incandenza's the Moms's disconnected head attached face-to-face to his own fine head strapped tight to his face somehow by a wrap-around system of VS HiPro top-shelf lamb-gut string from his Academy racquet's own face. So that no matter how frantically Orin tries to move his head or shake it side to side or twist up his face or roll his eyes he's still staring at into and somehow through his mother's face. As if the Moms's head was some sort of overtight helmet Orin can't wrestle his way out of.2 In the dream it's understandably vital to Orin that he disengage his head from the phylacteryish bind of his mother's disembodied head and he cannot. Last night's Subject's note indicates that at some point last night Orin had clutched her head with both hands and tried to sort of stiff-arm her though not in an ungentle or complaining way (the note not the stiff-arm). The apparent amputation of the Moms's head from the rest of the Moms appears in the dream to be clean and surgically neat: there is no evidence of a stump or any kind of nubbin of neck even and it is as if the base of the round pretty head had been sealed and also sort of rounded off so that her head is a large living ball a globe with a face attached to his own head's face. The Subject after Bain's sister but before the one just before this one with the Ambush scent and the hearts over i's the previous Subject had been a sallowly pretty Arizona State developmental psychology grad student with two kids and outrageous alimony and penchants for sharp jewelry refrigerated chocolate InterLace educational cartridges and professional athletes who thrashed in their sleep. Not real bright — she thought the figure he'd trace without thinking on her bare flank after sex was the numeral 8 to give you an idea. Their last morning together right before he'd mailed her child an expensive toy and then had his phone number changed he'd awakened from a night of horror-show dreams — woke up with an abrupt fetal spasm unrefreshed and benighted of soul his eyes wobbling and his wet silhouette on the bottom sheet like a coroner's chalk outline — he woke to find the Subject up and sitting up against the reading pillow wearing his sleeveless Academy sweatshirt and sipping hazelnut espresso and watching on the cartridge-viewing system that occupied half the bedroom's south wall something horrific called 'INTERLACE EDUCATIONAL CARTRIDGES IN CONJUNCTION WITH CBC EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING MATRIX PRESENTS SCHIZOPHRENIA: MIND OR BODY?' and had had to lie there moist and paralyzed curled fetal on his own sweat-shadow and watch on the viewer a pale young guy about Hal's age with copper stubble and a red cowlick and flat blank affectless black doll's eyes stare into space stage-left while a brisk Albertan voiceover explained that Fenton here was a dyed-in-the-wool paranoid schizophrenic who believed that radioactive fluids were invading his skull and that hugely complex high-tech-type machines had been specially designed and programmed to pursue him without cease until they caught him and made brutal sport of him and buried him alive. It was an old late-millennial CBC public-interest Canadian news documentary digitally sharpened and redisseminated under the Inter-Lace imprimatur — InterLace could get kind of seedy and low-rent during early-morning off-hours in terms of Spontaneous Disseminations. And so but since the old CBC documentary's thesis was turning out pretty clearly to be SCHIZOPHRENIA: BODY the voiceover evinced great clipped good cheer as it explained that well yes poor old Fenton here was more or less hopeless as an extra-institutional functioning unit but that on the up-side science could at least give his existence some sort of meaning by studying him very carefully to help learn how schizophrenia manifested itself in the human body's brain . . . that in other words with the aid of cutting-edge Positron-Emission Topography or 'P.E.T.' technology (since supplanted wholly by Invasive Digitals Orin hears the developmental psychology graduate student mutter to herself watching rapt over her cup unaware that Orin's paralytically awake) they could scan and study how different parts of poor old Fenton's dysfunctional brain emitted positrons in a whole different topography than your average hale and hearty nondelusional God-fearing Alber-tan's brain advancing science by injecting test-subject Fenton here with a special blood-brain-barrier-penetrating radioactive dye and then sticking him in the rotating body-sized receptacle of a P.E.T. Scanner — on the viewer it's an enormous gray-metal machine that looks like something co-designed by James Cameron and Fritz Lang and now have a look at this Fenton fellow's eyes as he starts to get the gist of what the voiceover's saying — and in a terse old Public-TV cut they now showed subject Fenton in five-point canvas restraints whipping his copper-haired head from side to side as guys in mint-green surgical masks and caps inject him with radioactive fluids through a turkey-baster-sized syringe then good old Fenton's eyes bugging out in total foreseen horror as he's rolled toward the huge gray P.E.T. device and slid like an unrisen loaf into the thing's open maw until only his decay-colored sneakers are in view and the body-sized receptacle rotates the test-subject counterclockwise with brutal speed so that the old sneakers point up and then left and then down and then right and then up faster and faster the machine's blurps and tweets not even coming close to covering Fenton's entombed howls as his worst delusional fears came true in digital stereo and you could hear the last surviving bits of his functional dye-permeated mind being screamed out of him for all time as the viewer digitally superimposed an image of Fenton's ember-red and neutron-blue brain in the lower-right corner where InterLace's Time/Temp functions usually appear and the brisk voiceover gave capsule histories of first paranoid schizophrenia and then P.E.T. With Orin lying there slit-eyed wet and neuralgic with A.M. dread wishing the Subject would put her own clothes and sharp jewelry on and take the rest of her Töblerone out of the freezer and go so he could go to the bathroom and get yesterday's asphyxiated roaches into an E.W.D. dumpster before the dumpsters all filled for the day and decide what kind of expensive present to mail the Subject's kid. And then the matter of the dead bird out of nowhere. And then news of pressure from the AZ Cardinal administration to cooperate with some sort of insipid-type personalityprofile series of interviews with some profiler from Moment magazine with personal backgroundish questions to be answered in some blandly sincere team-PR way the unexamined stress of which drives him to start calling Hallie again reopen that whole Pandora's box of worms. Orin also shaves in the shower face red with heat wreathed in steam by feel shaving upward with south-to-north strokes as he was taught. YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT Here's Hal Incandenza age seventeen with his little brass one-hitter getting covertly high in the Enfield Tennis Academy's underground Pump Room and exhaling palely into an industrial exhaust fan. It's the sad little interval after afternoon matches and conditioning but before the Academy's communal supper. Hal is by himself down here and nobody knows where he is or what he's doing. Hal likes to get high in secret but a bigger secret is that he's as attached to the secrecy as he is to getting high. A one-hitter sort of like a long FDR-type cigarette holder whose end is packed with a pinch of good dope gets hot and is hard on the mouth — the brass ones especially — but one-hitters have the advantage of efficiency: every particle of ignited pot gets inhaled; there's none of the incidental secondhand-type smoke from a party bowl's big load and Hal can take every iota way down deep and hold his breath forever so that even his exhalations are no more than slightly pale and sick-sweet-smelling. Total utilization of available resources = lack of publicly detectable waste. The Academy's tennis courts' Lung's Pump Room is underground and accessible only by tunnel. E.T.A. is abundantly embranchingly tunnelled. This is by design. Plus one-hitters are small which is good because let's face it anything you use to smoke high-resin dope with is going to stink. A bong is big and its stink is going to be like commensurately big plus you have the foul bong-water to deal with. Pipes are smaller and at least portable but they always come with only a multi-hit party bowl that disperses nonutilized smoke over a wide area. A one-hitter can be wastelessly employed then allowed to cool wrapped in two baggies and then further wrapped and sealed in a Ziploc and then enclosed in two sport-socks in a gear bag along with the lighter and eyedrops and mint-pellets and the little film-case of dope itself and it's highly portable and odor-free and basically totally covert. As far as Hal knows colleagues Michael Pemulis Jim Struck Bridget C. Boone Jim Troeltsch Ted Schacht Trevor Axford and possibly Kyle D. Coyle and Tall Paul Shaw and remotely possibly Frannie Unwin all know Hal gets regularly covertly high. It's also not impossible that Bernadette Longley knows actually; and of course the unpleasant K. Freer always has suspicions of all kinds. And Hal's brother Mario knows a thing or two. But that's it in terms of public knowledge. And but even though Pemulis and Struck and Boone and Troeltsch and Axford and occasionally (in a sort of medicinal or touristic way) Slice and Schacht all are known to get high also Hal has actually gotten actively high only with Pemulis on the rare occasions he's gotten high with anybody else as in in person which he avoids. He'd forgot: Ortho ('The Darkness') Slice of Partridge KS knows; and Hal's oldest brother Orin mysteriously even long-distance seems to know more than he's coming right out and saying unless Hal's reading more into some of the phone-comments than are there. Hal's mother Mrs. Avril Incandenza and her adoptive brother Dr. Charles Tavis the current E.T.A. Headmaster both know Hal drinks alcohol sometimes like on weekend nights with Troeltsch or maybe Axford down the hill at clubs on Commonwealth Ave.; The Unexamined Life has its notorious Blind Bouncer night every Friday where they card you on the Honor System. Mrs. Avril Incandenza isn't crazy about the idea of Hal drinking mostly because of the way his father had drunk when alive and reportedly his father's own father before him in AZ and CA; but Hal's academic precocity and especially his late competitive success on the junior circuit make it clear that he's able to handle whatever modest amounts she's pretty sure he consumes — there's no way someone can seriously abuse a substance and perform at top scholarly and athletic levels the E.T.A. psychcounselor Dr. Rusk assures her especially the high-level-athletic part — and Avril feels it's important that a concerned but unsmothering single parent know when to let go somewhat and let the two high-functioning of her three sons make their own possible mistakes and learn from their own valid experience no matter how much the secret worry about mistakes tears her gizzard out the mother's. And Charles supports whatever personal decisions she makes in conscience about her children. And God knows she'd rather have Hal having a few glasses of beer every so often than absorbing God alone knows what sort of esoteric designer compounds with reptilian Michael Pemulis and trail-of-slime-leaving James Struck both of whom give Avril a howling case of the maternal fantods. And ultimately she's told Drs. Rusk and Tavis she'd rather have Hal abide in the security of the knowledge that his mother trusts him that she's trusting and supportive and doesn't judge or gizzard-tear or wring her fine hands over his having for instance a glass of Canadian ale with friends every now and again and so works tremendously hard to hide her maternal dread of his possibly ever drinking like James himself or James's father all so that Hal might enjoy the security of feeling that he can be up-front with her about issues like drinking and not feel he has to hide anything from her under any circumstances. Dr. Tavis and Dolores Rusk have privately discussed the fact that not least among the phobic stressors Avril suffers so uncomplainingly with is a black phobic dread of hiding or secrecy in all possible forms with respect to her sons. Avril and C. T. know nothing about Hal's penchants for high-resin Bob Hope and underground absorption which fact Hal obviously likes a lot on some level though he's never given much thought to why. To why he likes it so much. E.T.A.'s hilltop grounds are traversable by tunnel. Avril I. for example who never leaves the grounds anymore rarely travels above ground willing to hunch to take the off-tunnels between Headmaster's House and her office next to Charles Tavis's in the Community and Administration Bldg. a pink-bricked white-pillared neo-Georgian thing that Hal's brother Mario says looks like a cube that has swallowed a ball too big for its stomach.3 Two sets of elevators and one of stairs run between the lobby reception area and administrative offices on Comm.-Ad.'s first floor and the weight room sauna and locker/shower areas on the sublevel below it. One large tunnel of elephant-colored cement leads from just off the boys' showers to the mammoth laundry room below the West Courts and two smaller tunnels radiate from the sauna area south and east to the subbasements of the smaller spherocubular pro to-Georgian buildings (housing classrooms and subdor-mitories B and D); these two basements and smaller tunnels often serve as student storage space and hallways between various prorectors'4 private rooms. Then two even smaller tunnels navigable by any adult willing to assume a kind of knuckle-dragging simian posture in turn connect each of the subbasements to the former optical and film-development facilities of Leith and Ogilvie and the late Dr. James O. Incandenza (now deceased) below and just west of the Headmaster's House (from which facilities there's also a fair-diametered tunnel that goes straight to the lowest level of the Community and Administration Bldg. but its functions have gradually changed over four years and it's now too full of exposed wiring and hot-water pipes and heating ducts to be really passable) and to the offices of the Physical Plant almost directly beneath the center row of E.T.A. outdoor tennis courts which offices and custodial lounge are in turn connected to E.T.A.'s Lung-Storage and -Pump Rooms via a pargeted tunnel hastily constructed by the TesTar Ail-Weather Inflatable Structures Corp. which together with the folks over at ATHSCME Industrial Air Displacement Devices erects and services the inflatable dendriurethane dome known as the Lung that covers the middle row of courts for the winter indoor season. The crude little rough-sided tunnel between Plant and Pump is traversable only via all-fours-type crawling and is essentially unknown to staff and Administration popular only with the Academy's smaller kids' Tunnel Club as well as with certain adolescents with strong secret incentive to crawl on all fours. The Lung-Storage Room is basically impassable from March through November because it's full of intricately folded dendriurethane Lung-material and dismantled sections of flexible ducting and fan-blades etc. The Pump Room is right next to it though you have to crawl back out into the tunnel to get to it. On the engineering diagrams the Pump Room's maybe about twenty meters directly beneath the centermost courts in the middle row of courts and looks like a kind of spider hanging upside-down — an unfenestrated oval chamber with six man-sized curved ducts radiating up and out to exit points on the grounds above. And the Pump Room has six radial openings one for each upcurving duct: three two-meter vents with huge turbine-bladed exhaust fans bolted into their grilles and three more 2M's with reversed ATHSCME intake fans that allow air from the ground above to be sucked down and around the room and up into the three exhaust vents. The Pump Room is essentially like a pulmonary organ or the epicenter of a massive six-vectored wind tunnel and when activated roars like a banshee that's slammed its hand in a door though the P.R.'s in full legit operation only when the Lung is up usually November-March. The intake fans pullground-level winter air down into and around the room and through the three exhaust fans and up the outtake ducts into networks of pneumatic tubing in the Lung's sides and dome: it's the pressure of the moving air that keeps the fragile Lung inflated. When the courts' Lung is down and stored Hal will descend and walk and then hunch his way in to make sure nobody's in the Physical Plant quarters then he'll hunch and crawl to the P.R. gear bag in his teeth and activate just one of the big exhaust fans and get secretly high and exhale palely through its blades into the vent so that any possible odor is blown through an outtake duct and expelled through a grille'd hole on the west side of the West Courts a threaded hole with a flange where brisk white-suited ATHSCME guys will attach some of the Lung's arterial pneumatic tubing at some point soon when Schtitt et al. on Staff decide the real weather has moved past enduring for outdoor tennis. During winter months when any expelled odor would get ducted up into the Lung and hang there conspicuous Hal mostly goes into a remote sub-dormitory lavatory and climbs onto a toilet in a stall and exhales into the grille of one of the little exhaust fans in the ceiling; but this routine lacks a certain intricate subterranean covert drama. It's another reason why Hal dreads Interdependence Day and the approach of the WhataBurger classic and Thanksgiving and unendurable weather and the erection of the Lung. Recreational drugs are more or less traditional at any U.S. secondary school maybe because of the unprecedented tensions: post-latency and puberty and angst and impending adulthood etc. To help manage the intra-psychic storms etc. Since the place's inception there's always been a certain percentage of the high-caliber adolescent players at E.T.A. who manage their internal weathers chemically. Much of this is good clean temporary fun; but a traditionally smaller and harder-core set tends to rely on personal chemistry to manage E.T.A.'s special demands — dexedríne or low-volt methedrine55 before matches and benzodiazapenes66 to come back down after matches with Mudslides or Blue Flames at some understanding Comm. Ave. nightspot77 or beers and bongs in some discreet Academy corner at night to short-circuit the up-and-down cycle mushrooms or X or something from the Mild Designer class88 — or maybe occasionally a little Black Star99 whenever there's a match- and demand-free weekend to basically short out the whole motherboard and blow out all the circuits and slowly recover and be almost neurologically reborn and start the gradual cycle all over again .. . this circular routine if your basic wiring's OK to begin with can work surprisingly well throughout adolescence and sometimes into one's like early twenties before it starts to creep up on you. But so some E.T.A.s — not just Hal Incandenza by any means — are involved with recreational substances is the point. Like who isn't at some life-stage in the U.S.A. and Interdependent regions in these troubled times for the most part. Though a decent percentage of E.T.A. students aren't at all. I.e. involved. Some persons can give themselves away to an ambitious pursuit and have that be all the giving-themselves-away-to-something they need to do. Though sometimes this changes as the players get older and the pursuit more stress-fraught. American experience seems to suggest that people are virtually unlimited in their need to give themselves away on various levels. Some just prefer to do it in secret. An enrolled student-athlete's use of alcohol or illicit chemicals is cause for immediate expulsion according to E.T.A.'s admissions catalogue. But the E.T.A. staff tends to have a lot more important stuff on its plate than policing kids who've already given themselves away to an ambitious competitive pursuit. The administrative attitude under first James Incandenza and then Charles Tavis is like why would anybody who wanted to compromise his faculties chemically even come here to E.T.A. where the whole point is to stress and stretch your faculties along multiple vectors.1010 And since it's the alumni prorectors who have the most direct supervisory contact with the kids and since most of the prorectors themselves are depressed or traumatized about not making it into the Show and having to come back to E.T.A. and live in decent but subterranean rooms off the tunnels and work as assistant coaches and teach laughable elective classes — which is what the eight E.T.A. prorectors do when they're not off playing Satellite tournaments or trying to make it through the qualifying rounds of some serious-money event — and so they're morose and low on morale and feel bad about themselves often as a rule and so also not all that surprisingly tend to get high now and then themselves though in a less covert or exuberant fashion than the hard-core students' chemical cadre but so given all this it's not hard to see why internal drug-enforcement at E.T.A. tends to be flaccid. The other nice thing about the Pump Room is the way it's connected by tunnel to the prorectors' rows of housing units which means men's rooms which means Hal can crawl hunch and tiptoe into an unoccupied men's room and brush his teeth with his portable Oral-B and wash his face and apply eyedrops and Old Spice and a plug of wintergreen Kodiak and then saunter back to the sauna area and ascend to ground level looking and smelling right as rain because when he gets high he develops a powerful obsession with having nobody — not even the neurochemical cadre — know he's high. This obsession is almost irresistible in its force. The amount of organization and toiletry-lugging he has to do to get secretly high in front of a subterranean outtake vent in the pre-supper gap would make a lesser man quail. Hal has no idea why this is or whence this obsession with the secrecy of it. He broods on it abstractly sometimes when high: this No-One-Must-Know thing. It's not fear per se fear of discovery. Beyond that it all gets too abstract and twined up to lead to anything Hal's brooding. Like most North Americans of his generation Hal tends to know way less about why he feels certain ways about the objects and pursuits he's devoted to than he does about the objects and pursuits themselves. It's hard to say for sure whether this is even exceptionally bad this tendency. At 0015h. 2 April the medical attache's wife is just leaving the Mount Auburn Total Fitness Center having played five sixgame pro-sets in her little Mideast-diplomatic-wife-tennis-circle's weekly round-robin then hung around the special Silver-KeyMembers' Lounge with the other ladies unwrapping her face and hair and playing Narjees1111 and all smoking kif and making extremely delicate and oblique fun of their husbands' sexual idiosyncrasies laughing softly with their hands over their mouths. The medical attache at their apartment is still viewing the unlabelled cartridge which he has rewound to the beginning several times and then configured for a recursive loop. He sits there attached to a congealed supper watching at 0020h. having now wet both his pants and the special recliner. Eighteen in May Mario Incandenza's designated function around Enfield Tennis Academy is filmic: sometimes during A.M. drills or P.M. matches he'll be assigned by Coach Schtitt et al. to set up an old camcorder or whatever video stuff's to hand on a tripod and record a certain area of court videotaping different kids' strokes footwork certain tics and hitches in serves or running volleys so the staff can show the tapes to the kids instructionally letting the kids see on the screen exactly what a coach or prorector's talking about. The reason being it's a lot easier to fix something if you can see it. AUTUMN — YEAR OF DAIRY PRODUCTS FROM THE AMERICAN HEARTLAND Drug addicts driven to crime to finance their drug addiction are not often inclined toward violent crime. Violence requires all different kinds of energy and most drug addicts like to expend their energy not on their professional crime but on what their professional crime lets them afford. Drug addicts are often burglars therefore. One reason why the home of someone whose home has been burglarized feels violated and unclean is that there have probably been drug addicts in there. Don Gately was a twentyseven-year-old oral narcotics addict (favoring Demerol and Talwin1212) and a more or less professional burglar; and he was himself unclean and violated. But he was a gifted burglar when he burgled — though the size of a young dinosaur with a massive and almost perfectly square head he used to amuse his friends when drunk by letting them open and close elevator doors on he was at his professional zenith smart sneaky quiet quick possessed of good taste and reliable transportation — with a kind of ferocious jolliness in his attitude toward his livelihood. As an active drug addict Gately was distinguished by his ferocious and jolly elan. He kept his big square chin up and his smile wide but he bowed neither toward nor away from any man. He took zero in the way of shit and was a cheery but implacable exponent of the Don't-Get-Mad-Get-Even school. Like for instance once after he'd done a really unpleasant three-month bit in Revere Holding on nothing more than a remorseless North Shore Assistant District Attorney's circumstantial suspicion finally getting out after 92 days when his P.D. got the charges dismissed on a right-to-speedy brief Gately and a trusted associate1313 paid a semiprofessional visit to the private home of this Assistant D.A. whose zeal and warrant had cost Gately a nasty impromptu detox on the floor of his little holding-cell. Also a believer in the Revenge-Is-Tastier-Chilled dictum Gately had waited patiently until the 'Eye On People' section of the Globe mentioned the A.D.A. and his wife's presence at some celebrity charity sailing thing out in Mar-blehead. Gately and the associate went that night to the A.D.A.'s private home in the upscale Wonderland Valley section of Revere killed the power to the home with a straight shunt in the meter's inflow then clipped just the ground wire on the home's pricey HBT alarm so that the alarm'd sound after ten or so minutes and create the impression that the perps had somehow bungled the alarm and been scared off in the middle of the act. Later that night when Revere's and Marblehead's Finest summoned them home the A.D.A. and his wife found themselves minus a coin collection and two antique shotguns and nothing more. Quite a few other valuables were stacked on the floor of the living room off the foyer like the perps hadn't had time to get them out of the house. Everything else in the burglarized home looked undisturbed. The A.D.A. was a jaded pro: he walked around touching the brim of his hat1414 and reconstructed probable events: the perps looked like they'd bungled disabling the alarm all the way and had got scared off by the thing's siren when the alarm's pricey HBT alternate ground kicked in at 300 v. The A.D.A. soothed his wife's sense of violation and uncleanliness. He calmly insisted on sleeping there in their home that very night; no hotel: it was like crucial to get right back on the emotional horse in cases like this he insisted. And then the next day the A.D.A. worked out the insurance and reported the shotguns to a buddy at A.T.F.1515 and his wife calmed down and life went on. About a month later an envelope arrived in the A.D.A.'s home's exquisite wrought-iron mailbox. In the envelope were a standard American Dental Association glossy brochure on the importance of daily oral hygiene — available at like any dentist's office anywhere — and two high-pixel Polaroid snapshots one of big Don Gately and one of his associate each in a Halloween mask denoting a clown's great good professional cheer each with his pants down and bent over and each with the enhanced-focus handle of one of the couple's toothbrushes protruding from his bottom. Don Gately had sense enough never to work the North Shore again after that. But he ended up in hideous trouble anyway A.D.A.-wise. It was either bad luck or kismet or so forth. It was because of a cold a plain old human rhinovirus. And not even Don Gately's cold is what made him finally stop and question his kismet. The thing started out looking like tit on a tray burglary-wise. A beautiful neo-Georgian home in a wildly upscale part of Brookline was set nicely back from an unlit pseudo-rural road had a chintzy SentryCo alarm system that fed idiotically enough on a whole separate 330 v AC 90 Hz cable with its own meter didn't seem to be on anything like a regular P.M.-patrol route and had at its rear flimsily tasteful French doors surrounded by dense and thorn-free deciduous shrubbery and blocked off from the garage's halogen floods by a private E.W.D.-issue upscale dumpster. It was in short a real cock-tease of a home burglary-wise for a drug addict. And Don Gately straight-shunted the alarm's meter and with an associate1616 broke and entered and crept around on huge cat feet. Except unfortunately the owner of the house turned out to be still home even though both of his cars and the rest of his family were gone. The little guy was asleep sick in bed upstairs in acetate pajamas with a hot water bottle on his chest and half a glass of OJ and a bottle of NyQuil1717 and a foreign book and copies of International Affairs and Interdependent Affairs and a pair of thick specs and an industrial-size box of Kleenex on the bedside table and an empty vaporizer barely humming at the foot of the bed and the guy was to say the least nonplussed to wake up and see high-filter flashlights crisscrossing over the unlit bedroom walls and bureau and teak chiffonnier as Gately and associate scanned for a wall-safe which surprisingly like 90% of people with wall-safes conceal in their master bedroom behind some sort of land- or seascape painting. People turned out so identical in certain root domestic particulars it made Gately feel strange sometimes like he was in possession of certain overlarge private facts to which no man should be entitled. Gately had a way stickier conscience about the possession of some of these large particular facts than he did about making off with other people's personal merchandise. But then all of a sudden in mid-silentsearch for a safe here's this upscale homeowner turning out to be home with a nasty head-cold while his family's out on a two-car foliage-tour in what's left of the Berkshires writhing groggily and Ny-Quilized around on the bed and making honking adenoidal sounds and asking what in bloody hell is the meaning of this except he's saying it in Québecois French which means to these thuggish U.S. drug addicts in Halloween-clowns' masks exactly nothing he's sitting up in bed a little and older-type homeowner with a football-shaped head and gray van Dyke and eyes you can tell are used to corrective lenses as he switches on the bright bedside lamp. Gately could easily have screwed out of there and never looked back; but here indeed in the lamplight is a seascape over next to the chiffonnier and the associate has a quick peek and reports that the safe behind it is to laugh at it can be opened with harsh language almost; and oral narcotics addicts tend to operate on an extremely rigid physical schedule of need and satisfaction and Gately is at this moment firmly in the need part of the schedule; and so D. W. Gately disastrously decides to go ahead and allow a nonviolent burglary to become in effect a robbery — which the operative legal difference involves either violence or the coercive threat of same — and Gately draws himself up to his full menacing height and shines his flashlight in the little homeowner's rheumy eyes and addresses him the way menacing criminals speak in popular entertainment — d's for th's various apocopes and so on — and takes hold of the guy's ear and conducts him down to a kitchen chair and binds his arms and legs to the chair with electrical cords neatly clipped from refrigerator and can-opener and M. Cafe-brand Automatic Café-au-LaitMaker binds him just short of gan-grenously tight because he's hoping the Berkshire foliage is prime and the guy's going to be soloing in this chair for a good stretch of time and Gately starts looking through the kitchen's drawers for the silverware — not the good-silver-for-company silverware; that was in a calfskin case underneath some neatly folded old spare Christmas wrapping in a stunning hardwood-with-ivory-inlay chest of drawers in the living room where over 90% of upscale people's good silver is always hidden and has already been promoted and is piled1818 just off the foyer — but just the regular old everyday flatware silverware because the vast bulk of homeowners keep their dish towels two drawers below their everyday-silverware drawer and God's made no better call-for-help-stifling gag in the world than a good old oily-smelling fake-linen dish towel; and the bound guy in the cords on the chair suddenly snaps to the implications of what Gately's looking for and is struggling and saying: Do not gag me I have a terrible cold my nose she is a brick of the snot I have not the power to breathe through the nose for the love of God please do not gag my mouth; and as a gesture of goodwill the homeowner tells Gately who's rummaging the combination of the bedroom's seascape safe except in French numbers which together with the honking adenoidal inflection the guy's grippe gives his speech doesn't even sound like human speech to Gately and but also the guy tells Gately there are some antique pre-Britishtakeover Québecois gold coins in a calfskin purse taped to the back of an undistinguished Impressionist landscape in the living room. But everything the Canadian homeowner says means no more to poor old Don Gately whistling a jolly tune and trying to look menacing in his clown's mask than the cries of say North Shore gulls or inland grackles; and sure enough the towels are two drawers under the spoons and here comes Gately across the kitchen looking like a sort of Bozo from hell and the Québecer guy's mouth goes oval with horror and into that mouth goes a balled-up faintly greasy-smelling kitchen towel and across the guy's cheeks and over the dome of protruding linen goes some fine-quality fibrous strapping tape from the drawer under the decommissioned phone — why does everybody keep the serious mailing supplies in the drawer nearest the kitchen phone? — and Don Gately and associate finish their swift and with-the-best-of-intentions nonviolent business of stripping the Brookline home as bare as a post-feral-hamster meadow and they relock the front door and hit the unlit road in Gately's reliable and doublemufflered 4x4. And the bound wheezing acetate-clad Canadian — the right-hand man to probably the most infamous antiO.N.A.N. organizer north of the Great Concavity the lieutenant and trouble-shooting trusted adviser who selflessly volunteered to move with his family to the savagely American area of metro Boston to act as liaison between and general leash-holder for the half-dozen or so malevolent and mutually antagonistic groups of Québecer Separatists and Albertan ultra-rightists united only in their fanatical conviction that the U.S.A.'s Experialistic 'gift' or 'return' of the so-calledly 'Reconfigured' Great Convexity to its northern neighbor and O.N.A.N. ally constituted an intolerable blow to Canadian sovereignty honor and hygiene — this homeowner unquestionably a V.I.P. although admittedly rather a covert V.I.P. or probably more accurately a 'P./.T.'1919 in French this meek-looking Canadian-terrorism-coordinator — bound to his chair thoroughly gagged sitting there alone under cold fluorescent kitchen lights2020 the rhinovirally afflicted man gagged with skill and quality materials — the guy having worked so hard to partially clear one clotted nasal passage that he tore intercostal ligaments in his ribs soon found even that pinprick of air blocked off by mucus's implacable lava-like flow once again and so has to tear more ligaments trying to breach the other nostril and so on; and after an hour of struggle and flames in his chest and blood on his lips and the white kitchen towel from trying frantically to tongue the towel out past the tape which is quality tape and after hopes skyrocketing when the doorbell rings and then hopes blackly dashed when the person at the door a young woman with a clipboard and chewing gum who's offering promotional coupons good for Happy Holidays discounts on memberships of six months or more at a string of Boston non-UV tanning salons shrugs in her parka and makes a mark on the clipboard and blithely retreats down the long driveway to the pseudorural road an hour of this or more finally the Québecois P.I.T. after unspeakable agony — slow suffocation mucoidal or no being no day at the Montreal Tulip-Fest — at the height of which agony hearing his head's pulse as receding thunder and watching his vision's circle shrink as a red aperture around his sight rotates steadily in from the edges at the height of which he could think only despite the pain and panic of what a truly dumb and silly way this was after all this time to die a thought which the towel and tape denied expression via the rueful grin with which the best men meet the dumbest ends — this Guillaume DuPlessis passed bluely from this life and sat there in the kitchen chair 250 clicks due east of some really spectacular autumn foliage for almost two nights and days his posture getting more and more military as rigor mortis set in with his bare feet looking like purple loaves of bread from the lividity; and when Brookline's Finest were finally summoned and got him unbound from the coldly lit chair they had to carry him out as if he were still seated so militarily comme-il-faut had his limbs and spine hardened. And poor old Don Gately whose professional habit of killing power with straight shunts to a meter's inflow was pretty much a signature M.O. and who had of course a special place in the heart of a remorseless Revere A.D.A. with judicial clout throughout Boston's three counties and beyond an of course particularly remorseless A.D.A. as of late whose wife now needed Valium even just to floss and was patiently awaiting his chance the A.D.A. was coldly biding his time being a patient Get-Even and Cold-Dish man just like Don Gately who was through no will to energy-consuming violence on his part in the sort of a hell of a deep-shit mess that can turn a man's life right around.

Again. It came on as he was suiting up warmly for the B-squad's O745h. drills. A cartridge of a round-of-16 match from September's U.S. Open had been on the small room viewer with the sound all the way down as usual and Troeltsch'd been straightening the straps on his jock idly calling the match's action into his fist when it came on. The illness. It came out of nowhere. His breathing all of a sudden started hurting the back of his throat. Then that overfull heat in various cranial meatus. Then he sneezed and the stuff he sneezed out was thick and doughy. It came on ultra-fast and out of the pre-drill blue. He's back in bed now supine watching the match's fourth set but not calling the action. The viewer's right under Pemulis's poster of the paranoid king2121 that you can't escape looking at if you want to look at the viewer. Clotted Kleenex litter the floor around his bed's wastebasket. The bedside table is littered with both OTC and prescription expectorants and pertussives and analgesics and Vitamin-C megaspansules and one bottle of Benadryl and one of Seldane2222 only the Seldane bottle actually contains several Tenuate 75-mg. capsules Troeltsch has incrementally promoted from Pemulis's part of the room and has rather ingeniously he thinks stashed in bold plain sight in a bedside pill bottle where the Peemster would never think to check. Troeltsch is the sort that can feel his own forehead and detect fever. It's definitely a rhinovirus the sudden severe kind. He speculated on if yesterday when Graham Rader pretended to sneeze on J. Troeltsch's lunchtray at the milk-dispenser at lunch if Rader might have really sneezed and only pretended to pretend transferring virulent rhinoviri to Troeltsch's delicate mu-cosa. He feverishly mentally calls down various cosmic retributions on Rader. Neither of Troeltsch's roommates is here. Ted Schacht is getting the knee's first of several whirlpools for the day. Pemulis has geared up and left for 0745 drills. Troeltsch offered Pemulis rights to his breakfast to fill up his vaporizer for him and call the first-shift nurse for 'yet more' Seldane nuclear-grade antihistamine and a dextromethorphan nebulizer and a written excuse from A.M. drills. He lies there sweating freely watching digitally recorded professional tennis too worried about his throat to feel loquacious enough to call the action. Seldane is not supposed to make you drowsy but he feels weak and unpleasantly drowsy. He can barely make a fist. He's sweaty. Nausea/vomiting like not an impossibility by any means. He cannot believe how fast it came on the illness. The vaporizer seethes and burps and all four of the room's windows weep against the outside cold. There are the sad tiny distant-champagnecork sounds of scores of balls being hit down at the East Courts. Troeltsch drifts at a level just above sleep. Enormous ATHSCME displacement fans far up north at the wall and border's distant roar and the outdoor voices and pock of cold balls create a kind of sound-carpet below the digestive sounds of the vaporizer and the squeak of Troeltsch's bedsprings as he thrashes and twitches in a moist half-sleep. He has heavy German eyebrows and big-knuckled hands. It's one of those unpleasant opioid feverish half-sleep states more a fugue-state than a sleep-state less a floating than like being cast adrift on rough seas tossed mightily in and out of this half-sleep where your mind's still working and you can ask yourself whether you're asleep even as you dream. And any dreams you do have seem ragged at the edges gnawed on incomplete. It's literally 'daydreaming' sick the kind of incomplete fugue you awaken from with a sort of psychic clunk struggling up to sit upright convinced there's someone unauthorized in the dorm room with you. Falling back sick on his circle-stained pillow staring straight up into the prolix folds of the Turkish blanketish thing Pemulis and Schacht had Krazy-Glued to the ceiling's corners which billows hanging so its folds form a terrain like with valleys and shadows. I am coming to see that the sensation of the worst nightmares a sensation that can be felt asleep or awake is identical to those worst dreams' form itself: the sudden intra-dream realization that the nightmares' very essence and center has been with you all along even awake: it's just been . .. overlooked; and then that horrific interval between realizing what you've overlooked and turning your head to look back at what's been right there all along the whole time.... Your first nightmare away from home and folks your first night at the Academy it was there all along: The dream is that you awaken from a deep sleep wake up suddenly damp and panicked and are overwhelmed with the sudden feeling that there is a distillation of total evil in this dark strange subdorm room with you that evil's essence and center is right here in this room right now. And is for you alone. None of the other little boys in the room are awake; the bunk above yours sags dead motionless; no one moves; no one else in the room feels the presence of something radically evil; none thrash or sit damply up; no one else cries out: whatever it is is not evil for them. The flashlight your mother name-tagged with masking tape and packed for you special pans around the institutional room: the drop-ceiling the gray striped mattress and bulged grid of bunksprings above you the two other bunkbeds another matte gray that won't return light the piles of books and compact disks and tapes and tennis gear; your disk of white light trembling like the moon on water as it plays over the identical bureaus the recessions of closet and room's front door door's frame's bolections; the cone of light pans over fixtures the lumpy jumbles of sleeping boys' shadows on the snuff-white walls the two rag throw-rugs' ovals on the hardwood floor black lines of baseboards' reglets the cracks in the Venetian blinds that ooze the violet nonlight of a night with snow and just a hook of moon; the flashlight with your name in maternal cursive plays over every cm. of the walls the rheostats CD Inter-Lace poster of Tawni Kondo phone console desks' TPs the face in the floor posters of pros the onionskin yellow of the desklamps' shades the ceiling-panels' patterns of pinholes the grid of upper bunk's springs recession of closet and door boys wrapped in blankets slight crack like a creek's course in the eastward ceiling discernible now maple reglet border at seam of ceiling and walls north and south no floor has a face your flashlight showed but didn't no never did see its eyes' pupils set sideways and tapered like a cat's its eyebrows' \ / and horrid toothy smile leering right at your light all the time you've been scanning oh mother a face in the floor mother oh and your flashlight's beam stabs jaggedly back for the overlooked face misses it overcorrects then centers on what you'd felt but had seen without seeing just now as you'd so carefully panned the light and looked a face in the floor there all the time but unfelt by all others and unseen by you until you knew just as you felt it didn't belong and was evil: Evil. And then its mouth opens at your light. And then you wake like that quivering like a struck drum lying there awake and quivering summoning courage and spit roll to the right just as in the dream for the nametagged flashlight on the floor by the bed just in case lie there on your shank and side shining the light all over just as in the dream. Lie there panning looking all ribs and elbows and dilated eyes. The awake floor is littered with gear and dirty clothes blond hardwood with sealed seams two throw-rugs the bare waxed wood shiny in the windows' snowlight the floor neutral faceless you cannot see any face in the floor awake lying there faceless blank dilated playing beam over floor again and again not sure all night forever unsure you're not missing something that's right there: you lie there awake and almost twelve believing with all your might. AS OF YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT The Enfield Tennis Academy has been in accredited operation for three pre-Subsidized years and then eight Subsidized years first under the direction of Dr. James Incandenza and then under the administration of his half-brother-in-law Charles Tavis Ed.D. James Orin Incandenza — the only child of a former top U.S. jr. tennis player and then promising young pre-Method actor who during the interval of J. O. Incandenza's early formative years had become a disrespected and largely unemployable actor driven back to his native Tucson AZ and dividing his remaining energies between stints as a tennis pro at ranch-type resorts and then short-run productions at something called the Desert Beat Theater Project the father a dipsomania-cal tragedian progressively crippled by obsessions with death by spider-bite and by stage fright and with a bitterness of ambiguous origin but consuming intensity toward the Method school of professional acting and its more promising exponents a father who somewhere around the nadir of his professional fortunes apparently decided to go down to his Raid-sprayed basement workshop and build a promising junior athlete the way other fathers might restore vintage autos or build ships inside bottles or like refinish chairs etc. — James Incandenza proved a withdrawn but compliant student of the game and soon a gifted jr. player — tall bespectacled domineering at net — who used tennis scholarships to finance on his own private secondary and then higher education at places just about as far away from the U.S. Southwest as one could get without drowning. The United States government's prestigious O.N.R.2323 financed his doctorate in optical physics fulfilling something of a childhood dream. His strategic value during the Federal interval G. Ford-early G. Bush as more or less the top applied-geometrical-optics man in the O.N.R. and S.A.C. designing neutron-scattering reflectors for thermo-strategic weapons systems then in the Atomic Energy Commission — where his development of gamma-refractive indices for lithium-anodized lenses and panels is commonly regarded as one of the big halfdozen discoveries that made possible cold annular fusion and approximate energy-independence for the U.S. and its various allies and protectorates — his optical acumen translated after an early retirement from the public sector into a patented fortune in rearview mirrors light-sensitive eyewear holographic birthday and Xmas greeting cartridges vid-eophonic Tableaux homolosine-cartography software nonfluorescent public-lighting systems and film-equipment; then in the optative retirement from hard science that building and opening a U.S.T.A.-accredited and ped-agogically experimental tennis academy apparently represented for him into 'après-garde' experimental- and conceptual-film work too far either ahead of or behind its time possibly to be much appreciated at the time of his death in the Year of the Trial-Size Dove Bar — although a lot of it (the experimentaland conceptual-film work) was admittedly just plain pretentious and unengaging and bad and probably not helped at all by the man's very gradual spiral into the crippling dipsomania of his late father.2424 The tall ungainly socially challenged and hard-drinking Dr. Incandenza's May-December2525 marriage to one of the few bona fide bombshell-type females in North American academia the extremely tall and high-strung but also extremely pretty and gainly and teetotalling and classy Dr. Avril Mondragon the only female academic ever to hold the Macdonald Chair in Prescriptive Usage at the Royal Victoria College of McGill University whom Incandenza'd met at a U. Toronto conference on Reflective vs. Reflexive Systems was rendered even more romantic by the bureaucratic tribulations involved in obtaining an Exitand then an Entrance-Visa to say nothing of a Green Card for even a U.S.-spoused Professor Mondragon whose involvement however demonstrably nonviolent with certain members of the Québecois-Separatist Left while in graduate school had placed her name on the R.C.M.P.'s notorious 'Personnes a Qui On Doit Surveiller Attentivement' List. The birth of the Incandenzas' first child Orin had been at least partly a legal maneuver. It is known that during the last five years of his life Dr. James O. Incan-denza liquidated his assets and patent-licenses ceded control over most of the Enfield Tennis Academy's operations to his wife's half-brother — a former engineer most recently employed in Amateur Sports Administration at Throppinghamshire Provincial College New Brunswick Canada — and devoted his unimpaired hours almost exclusively to the production of documentaries technically recondite art films and mordantly obscure and obsessive dramatic cartridges leaving behind a substantial (given the late age at which he bloomed creatively) number of completed films and cartridges some of which have earned a small academic following for their technical feck and for a pathos that was somehow both surreally abstract and CNS-rendingly melodramatic at the same time. Professor James O. Incandenza Jr.'s untimely suicide at fifty-four was held a great loss in at least three worlds. President J. Gentle (EC.) acting on behalf of the U.S.D.D.'s O.N.R. and O.N.A.N.'s post-annular A.E.C. conferred a posthumous citation and conveyed his condolences by classified ARPA-NET Electronic Mail. Incandenza's burial in Quebec's L'Islet County was twice delayed by annular hyperfloration cycles. Cornell University Press announced plans for a festschrift. Certain leading young quote 'après-garde' and 'anticonfluential' filmmakers employed in their output for the Year of the Trial-Size Dove Bar certain oblique visual gestures — most involving the chiaroscuro lamping and custom-lens effects for which Incandenza's distinctive deep focus was known — that paid the sort of deep-insider's elegaic tribute no audience could be expected to notice. An interview with Incandenza was posthumously included in a book on the genesis of annulation. And those of E.T.A.'s junior players whose hypertrophied arms could fit inside them wore black bands on court for almost a year. DENVER CO 1 NOVEMBER YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT 'I hate this!' Orin yells out to whoever glides near. He doesn't loop or spiral like the showboats; he sort of tacks the gliding equivalent of snow-plowing unspectacular and aiming to get it over ASAP and intact. The fake red wings' nylon clatters in an updraft; ill-glued feathers keep peeling off and rising. The updraft is the oxides from Mile-High's thousands of open mouths. Far and away the loudest stadium anyplace. He feels like a dick. The beak makes it hard to breathe and see. Two reserve ends do some kind of combined barrel-roll thing. The worst is the moment right before they make the jump off the stadium's rim. Hands in the top rows reaching and clutching. People laughing. The Interlace cameras panning and tightening; Orin knows too well the light on the side that means Zoom. Once they're out over the field the voices melt and merge into oxides and updraft. The left guard is soaring up instead of down. A couple beaks and a claw fall off somebody and go pinwheeling down toward the green. Orin tacks grimly back and forth. He's among those who steadfastly refuse to whistle or squawk. Bonus or no. The stadium loudspeaker's a steely gargle. You can never hear it clearly even on the ground. The sad old ex-QB who now just holds on place-kicks falls in beside Orin's slow back-and-forth about 100 meters over the 40. He's one of the token females his beak blunter and wings' red nongarish. 'Hate and loathe this with a clusterfucking passion Clayt!’ The holder tries to make a resigned wing-gesture and is almost blown into Orin's pinfeathers. 'Almost down! Enjoy the ride! Yo — cleavage-check in 22G just by the —' and then lost in the roar as the first player touches down and sheds the red-feathered promotional apparatus. You have to scream to even be heard. At some point it starts sounding like the crowd's roaring at its own roar a doubling-back quality like something'll blow. One of the Broncos in the rear end of a costume takes a header at midfield so it looks like the thing's ass went flying off. Orin has told no Cardinal not even the team's counselor and visualization-therapist about his morbid fear of heights and high-altitude descent. 'I punt! I'm paid to punt long high well and always! Making me do personal interviews on my personal side's bad enough! But this crosses every line! Why do we stand for this! I'm an athlete! I'm not a freak-show performer! Nobody mentioned flying at the trade-table. In New Orleans it was just robes and halos and once a season a zither. But just once a season. This is fucking awful!’ 'Could be worse!’ Spiralling down toward the line of X's and the bill-capped guys that help strip the wings off runty potbellied volunteer frontoffice-connected guys who always smirk in a way you couldn't quite level the accusation. 'I'm paid to punt!’ 'It's worse in Philly! ... had fucking water-drops in Seattle for three seaso—’ 'Please Lord spare the Leg' Orin whispers each time just before touchdown. '. .. of how you could be an Oiler! You could be a Brown.’ The organopsychedelic muscimole an isoxazole-alkaloid derived from Amanita muscaria a.k.a. the fly agaric mushroom — by no means Michael Pemulis emphasizes to be confused with phalloides or verna or certain other kill-you-dead species of North America's Amanita genus as the little kids sit there Indian-style on the Viewing Room floor glassy-eyed and trying not to yawn — goes by the structural moniker 5-aminomethyl-3-isoxazolol requires about like maybe ten to twenty oral mg. per ingestion making it two to three times as potent as psilocybin and frequently results in the following alterations in consciousness (not reading or referring to notes in any way): a kind of semi-sleep-like trance with visions elation sensations of physical lightness and increased strength heightened sensual perceptions synesthesia and favorable distortions in body-image. This is supposed to be a pre-dinner 'Big Buddy' powwow where the littler kids receive general big-brotherly-type support and counsel from an upperclass-man. Pemulis sometimes treats his group's powwows like a kind of colloquium sharing personal findings and interests. The viewer's on Read from the room's laptop and the screen's got block-capitaled METHOXYLATED BASES FOR PHENYLKYLAMINE MANIPULATION on it and underneath some stuff that might as well be Greek to the Little Buds. Two of the kids squeeze tennis balls; two rock and bob Hasidically to stay alert; one has a hat with a pair of fake antennae made of tightcoiled spring. More or less revered by the aboriginal tribes of what's now southern Quebec and the Great Concavity Pemulis tells them the fly agaric 'shroom was both loved and hated for its powerful but not always unless carefully titrated pleasant psychospiritual effects. A boy probes at his own navel with great interest. Another pretends to fall over. Some of the more marginal players start in as early as maybe twelve I'm sorry to say particularly 'drines before matches and then enkephaline2626 after which can generate a whole vicious circle of individual neurochemis-try; but I myself having taken certain vows early on concerning fathers and differences didn't even get downwind of my first bit of Bob Hope2727 until fifteen more like nearly sixteen when Bridget Boone in whose room a lot of the 16 and Unders used to congregate before lights-out invited me to consider a couple of late-night bongs as a kind of psychodysleptic Sominex to help me sleep perhaps finally all the way through a really unpleasant dream that had been recurring nightly and waking me up in medias for weeks and was beginning to grind me down and to cause some slight deterioration in performance and rank. Low-grade synthetic Bob or not the bongs worked like a charm. In this dream which every now and then still recurs I am standing publicly at the baseline of a gargantuan tennis court. I'm in a competitive match clearly: there are spectators officials. The court is about the size of a football field though maybe it seems. It's hard to tell. But mainly the court's complex. The lines that bound and define play are on this court as complex and convolved as a sculpture of string. There are lines going every which way and they run oblique or meet and form relationships and boxes and rivers and tributaries and systems inside systems: lines corners alleys and angles deliquesce into a blur at the horizon of the distant net. I stand there tentatively. The whole thing is almost too involved to try to take in all at once. It's simply huge. And it's public. A silent crowd resolves itself at what may be the court's periphery dressed in summer's citrus colors motionless and highly attentive. A battalion of linesmen stand blandly alert in their blazers and safari hats hands folded over their slacks' flies. High overhead near what might be a net-post the umpire blue-blazered wired for amplification in his tall high-chair whispers Play. The crowd is a tableau motionless and attentive. I twirl my stick in my hand and bounce a fresh yellow ball and try to figure out where in all that mess of lines I'm supposed to direct service. I can make out in the stands stage-left the white sun-umbrella of the Moms; her height raises the white umbrella above her neighbors; she sits in her small circle of shadow hair white and legs crossed and a delicate fist upraised and tight in total unconditional support. The umpire whispers Please Play. We sort of play. But it's all hypothetical somehow. Even the 'we' is theory: I never get quite to see the distant opponent for all the apparatus of the game. YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT Doctors tend to enter the arenas of their profession's practice with a brisk good cheer that they have to then stop and try to mute a bit when the arena they're entering is a hospital's fifth floor a psych ward where brisk good cheer would amount to a kind of gloating. This is why doctors on psych wards so often wear a vaguely fake frown of puzzled concentration if and when you see them in fifth-floor halls. And this is why a hospital M.D. — who's usually hale and pink-cheeked and poreless and who almost always smells unusually clean and good — approaches any psych patient under his care with a professional manner somewhere between bland and deep a distant but sincere concern that's divided evenly between the patient's subjective discomfort and the hard facts of the case. The doctor who poked his fine head just inside her hot room's open door and knocked maybe a little too gently on the metal jamb found Kate Gom-pert lying on her side on the slim hard bed in blue jeans and a sleeveless blouse with her knees drawn up to her abdomen and her fingers laced around her knees. Something almost too overt about the pathos of the posture: this exact position was illustrated in some melancholic Watteau-era print on the frontispiece to Yevtuschenko's Field Guide to Clinical States. Kate Gompert wore dark-blue boating sneakers without socks or laces. Half her face obscured by the either green or yellow case on the plastic pillow her hair so long-unwashed it had separated into discrete shiny strands and black bangs lay like a cell's glossy bars across the visible half of the forehead. The psych ward smelled faintly of disinfectant and the Community Lounge's cigarette smoke the sour odor of medical waste awaiting collection with also that perpetual slight ammoniac tang of urine and there was the double bing of the elevator and the always faraway sound of the intercom paging some M.D. and some high-volume cursing from a manic in the pink Quiet Room at the other end of the psych-ward hall from the Community Lounge. Kate Gompert's room also smelled of singed dust from the heat-vent also of the over-sweet perfume worn by the young mental health staffer who sat in a chair at the foot of the girl's bed chewing blue gum and viewing a soundless ROM cartridge on a ward-issue laptop. Kate Gompert was on Specials which meant Suicide-Watch which meant that the girl had at some point betrayed both Ideation and Intent which meant she had to be watched right up close by a staffer twenty-four hours a day until the supervising M.D. called off the Specials. Staffers rotated Specials-duty every hour ostensibly so that whoever was on duty was always fresh and keenly observant but really because simply sitting there at the foot of a bed looking at somebody who was in so much psychic pain she wanted to commit suicide was incredibly depressing and boring and unpleasant so they spread the odious duty out as thin as they possibly could the staffers. They were not technically supposed to read do paperwork view CD-ROMs do personal grooming or in any way divert their attention from the patient on Specials on-duty. The patient Ms. Gompert seemed both to be fighting for breath and to be breathing rapidly enough to induce hypocapnia; the doctor could not be expected not also to notice that she had fairly large breasts that rose and fell rapidly inside the circle of arms with which she hugged her knees. The girl's eyes which were dull had registered his appearance in the doorway but they didn't seem to track as he came toward the bed. The staffer was also employing an emery board. The doctor told the staffer that he was going to need a few moments alone with Ms. Gompert. It is a sort of requirement that a doctor whenever possible be reading or at least looking down at something on his clipboard when addressing a subordinate so the doctor was looking studiously at the patient's Intake and the sheaf of charts and records Med-Netted over from trauma and psych wards in some other city hospitals. Gompert Katherine A. 21 Newton MA. Data-clerical in a Wellesley Hills real estate office. Fourth hospitalization in three years all clinical depression unipolar. One series of electro-convulsive treatments out at Newton-Wellesley Hospital two years back. On Prozac for a short time then Zoloft most recently Parnate with a lithium kicker. Two previous suicide attempts the second just this past summer. Bi-Valium discontinued two years Xanax discontinued one year — an admitted history of abusing prescribed meds. Depressions unipolar fairly classic characterized by acute dysphoria anxiety w/panic diurnal listlessness/agitation patterns Ideation w/w/o Intent. First attempt a CO-episode garage's automobile had stalled before lethal hemotoxicity achieved. Then last year's attempt — no scarring now visible her wrists' vascular nodes obscured by the insides of the knees she held. She continued to stare at the doorway where he'd first appeared. This latest attempt a straightforward meds O.D. Admitted via the E.R. three nights past. Two days on ventilation after a Pump & Purge. Hypertensive crisis on the second day from metabolic retox — she must have taken a hell of a lot of meds — the I.C.U. charge nurse had beeped the chaplain so the retox must have been bad. Almost died twice this time Katherine Ann Gompert. Third day spent on 2-West for observation Li-brium reluctantly administered for a B.P. that was all over the map. Now here on 5 his present arena. B.P. stable as of the last four readings. Next vitals at 1300h. The attempt had been serious a real attempt. This girl had not been futzing around. A bona fide clinical admit right out of Yevtuschenko or Dretske. Over half the admits to psych wards are things like cheerleaders who swallow two bottles of Mydol over a high-school breakup or gray lonely asexual depressing people rendered inconsolable by the death of a pet. The cathartic trauma of actually going in somewhere officially Psych- some understanding nods some bare indication somebody gives half a damn — they rally back out they go. Three determined attempts and a course of shock spelled no such case here. The doctor's interior state was somewhere between trepidation and excitement which manifested outwardly as a sort of blandly deep puzzled concern. The doctor said Hi and that he wanted to ascertain for sure that she was Katherine Gompert as they hadn't met before up till now. 'That's me' in a bit of a bitter singsong. Her voice was oddly lit-up for one who lay fetal dead-eyed w/o facial affect. The doctor said could she tell him a little bit about why she's here with them right now? Can she remember back to what happened? She took an even deeper breath. She was attempting to communicate boredom or irritation. 'I took a hundred-ten Parnate about thirty Lithonate capsules some old Zoloft. I took everything I had in the world.’ 'You really must have wanted to hurt yourself then it seems.’ 'They said downstairs the Parnate made me black out. It did a blood pressure thing. My mother heard noises upstairs and found me she said down on my side chewing the rug in my room. My room's shag-carpeted. She said I was on the floor flushed red and all wet like when I was a newborn; she said she thought at first she hallucinated me as a newborn again. On my side all red and wet.’ 'A hypertensive crisis will do that. It means your blood pressure was high enough to have killed you. Sertraline in combination with an MAOI2828 will kill you in enough quantities. And with the toxicity of that much lithium besides I'd say you're pretty lucky to be here right now.’ 'My mother sometimes thinks she's hallucinating.’ 'Sertraline by the way is the Zoloft you kept instead of discarding as instructed when changing medications.’ 'She says I chewed a big hole out of the carpet. But who can say.’ The doctor chose his second-finest pen from the array in his white coat's breast pocket and made some sort of note on Kate Gompert's new chart for this particular psych ward. Crowded in among his pocket's pens was the rubber head of a diagnostic plexor. He asked Kate if she could tell him why she had wanted to hurt herself. Had she been angry at herself. At someone else. Had she ceased to feel as though her life had meaning to it. Had she heard anything like voices suggesting that she hurt herself. There was no audible response. The girl's breathing had slowed to just rapid. The doctor took an early clinical gamble and asked Kate whether it might not be easier if she rolled over and sat up so that they could speak with each other more normally face to face. 'I am sitting up.’ The doctor's pen was poised. His slow nod was studious blandly puzzled-seeming. 'You mean to say you feel right now as if your body is already in a sitting-up position?’ She rolled an eye up at him for a long moment sighed meaningfully and rolled and rose. Katherine Ann Gompert probably felt that here was yet another psych-ward M.D. with zero sense of humor. This was probably because she did not understand the strict methodological limits that dictated how literal he a doctor had to be with the admits on the psych ward. Nor that jokes and sarcasm were here usually too pregnant and fertile with clinical significance not to be taken seriously: sarcasm and jokes were often the bottle in which clinical depressives sent out their most plangent screams for someone to care and help them. The doctor — who by the way wasn't an M.D. yet but a resident here on a twelve-week psych rotation — indulged this clinical reverie while the patient made an elaborate show of getting the thin pillow out from under her and leaning it up the tall way against the bare wall behind the bed and slumping back against it her arms crossed over her breasts. The doctor decided that her open display of irritation with him could signify either a positive thing or nothing at all. Kate Gompert stared at a point over the man's left shoulder. 'I wasn't trying to hurt myself. I was trying to kill myself. There's a difference.’ The doctor asked whether she could try to explain what she felt the difference was between those two things. The delay that preceded her reply was only marginally longer than the pause in a regular civilian conversation. The doctor had no ideas about what this observation might indicate. 'Do you guys see different kinds of suicides?’ The resident made no attempt to ask Kate Gompert what she meant. She used one finger to remove some material from the corner of her mouth. 'I think there must be probably different types of suicides. I'm not one of the self-hating ones. The type of like "I'm shit and the world'd be better off without poor me" type that says that but also imagines what everybody'll say at their funeral. I've met types like that on wards. Poor-me-I-hate-me-punish-me-come-to-my-funeral. Then they show you a 20 X 25 glossy of their dead cat. It's all self-pity bullshit. It's bullshit. I didn't have any special grudges. I didn't fail an exam or get dumped by anybody. All these types. Hurt themselves.' Still that intriguing unsettling combination of blank facial masking and conventionally animated vocal tone. The doctor's small nods were designed to appear not as responses but as invitations to continue what Dretske called Momentumizers. 'I didn't want to especially hurt myself. Or like punish. I don't hate myself. I just wanted out. I didn't want to play anymore is all.’ 'Play' nodding in confirmation making small quick notes. 'I wanted to just stop being conscious. I'm a whole different type. I wanted to stop feeling this way. If I could have just put myself in a really long coma I would have done that. Or given myself shock I would have done that. Instead.’ The doctor was writing with great industry. 'The last thing more I'd want is hurt. I just didn't want to feel this way anymore. I don't... I didn't believe this feeling would ever go away. I don't. I still don't. I'd rather feel nothing than this.’ The doctor's eyes appeared keenly interested in an abstract way. They looked severely magnified behind his attractive but thick glasses the frames of which were steel. Patients on other floors during other rotations had sometimes complained that they sometimes felt like something in a jar he was studying intently through all that thick glass. He was saying 'This feeling of wanting to stop feeling by dying then is —’ The way she suddenly shook her head was vehement exasperated. 'The feeling is why I want to. The feeling is the reason I want to die. I'm here because I want to die. That's why I'm in a room without windows and with cages over the lightbulbs and no lock on the toilet door. Why they took my shoelaces and my belt. But I notice they don't take away the feeling do they.’ 'Is the feeling you're explaining something you've experienced in your other depressions then Katherine?’ The patient didn't respond right away. She slid her foot out of her shoes and touched one bare foot with the toes of the other foot. Her eyes tracked this activity. The conversation seemed to have helped her focus. Like most clinically depressed patients she appeared to function better in focused activity than in stasis. Their normal paralyzed stasis allowed these patients' own minds to chew them apart. But it was always a titanic struggle to get them to do anything to help them focus. Most residents found the fifth floor a depressing place to do a rotation. 'What I'm trying to ask I think is whether this feeling you're communicating is the feeling you associate with your depression.’ Her gaze moved off. 'That's what you guys want to call it I guess.’ The doctor clicked his pen slowly a few times and explained that he's more interested here in what she would choose to call the feeling since it was her feeling. The resumed study of the movement of her feet. 'When people call it that I always get pissed off because I always think depression sounds like you just get like really sad you get quiet and melancholy and just like sit quietly by the window sighing or just lying around. A state of not caring about anything. A kind of blue kind of peaceful state.' She seemed to the doctor decidedly more animated now even as she seemed unable to meet his eyes. Her respiration had sped back up. The doctor recalled classic hyperventila-tory episodes being characterized by carpopedal spasms and reminded himself to monitor the patient's hands and feet carefully during the interview for any signs of tetanic contraction in which case the prescribed therapy would be I.V. calcium in a saline percentage he would need quickly to look up. 'Well this' — she gestured at herself— 'isn't a state. This is a feeling. I feel it all over. In my arms and legs.’ 'That would include your carp—your hands and feet?’ 'All over. My head throat butt. In my stomach. It's all over everywhere. I don't know what I could call it. It's like I can't get enough outside it to call it anything. It's like horror more than sadness. It's more like horror. It's like something horrible is about to happen the most horrible thing you can imagine — no worse than you can imagine because there's the feeling that there's something you have to do right away to stop it but you don't know what it is you have to do and then it's happening too the whole horrible time it's about to happen and also it's happening all at the same time.’ 'So you'd say anxiety is a big part of your depressions.’ It was now not clear whether she was responding to the doctor or not. 'Everything gets horrible. Everything you see gets ugly. Lurid is the word. Doctor Carton said lurid one time. That's the right word for it. And everything sounds harsh spiny and harshsounding like every sound you hear all of a sudden has teeth. And smelling like I smell bad even after I just got out of the shower. It's like what's the point of washing if everything smells like I need another shower.’ The doctor looked intrigued rather than concerned for a moment as he wrote all this down. He preferred handwritten notes to a laptop because he felt M.D.s who typed into their laps during clinical interviews gave a cold impression. Kate Gompert's face writhed for a moment while the doctor was writing. 'I fear this feeling more than I fear anything man. More than pain or my mom dying or environmental toxicity. Anything.’ 'Fear is a major part of anxiety' the doctor confirmed. Katherine Gompert seemed to come out of her dark reverie for a moment. She stared full-frontal at the doctor for several seconds and the doctor who'd had all discomfort at being stared at by patients trained right out of him when he'd rotated through the paralysis/-plegia wards upstairs was able to look directly back at her with a kind of bland compassion the expression of someone who was compassionate but was not of course feeling what she was feeling and who honored her subjective feelings by not even trying to pretend that he was. Sharing them. The young woman's expression in turn revealed that she had decided to take what amounted for her to her own gamble this early in a therapeutic relationship. The abstract resolve on her face now duplicated what had been on the doctor's face when he'd taken the gamble of asking her to sit up straight. 'Listen' she said. 'Have you ever felt sick? I mean nauseous like you knew you were going to throw up?’ The doctor made a gesture like Well sure. 'But that's just in your stomach' Kate Gompert said. 'It's a horrible feeling but it's just in your stomach. That's why the term is "sick to your stomach." ' She was back to looking intently at her lower carpopedals. 'What I told Dr. Garton is OK but imagine if you felt that way all over inside. All through you. Like every cell and every atom or brain-cell or whatever was so nauseous it wanted to throw up but it couldn't and you felt that way all the time and you're sure you're positive the feeling will never go away you're going to spend the rest of your natural life feeling like this.’ The doctor wrote down something much too brief to correspond directly to what she'd said. He was nodding both while he wrote and when he looked up. 'And yet this nauseated feeling has come and gone for you in the past it's passed eventually during prior depressions Katherine has it not?’ 'But when you're in the feeling you forget. The feeling feels like it's always been there and will always be there and you forget. It's like this whole filter drops down over the whole way you think about everything a couple weeks after —’ They sat and looked at each other. The doctor felt some combination of intense clinical excitement and anxiety about perhaps saying the wrong thing at such a crucial juncture and fouling up. His last name was needle-pointed in yellow braid on the left breast of the white coat he was required to wear. 'I'm sorry? A couple weeks after— ?’ He waited for seven breaths. 'I want shock' she said finally. 'Isn't part of this whole concerned kindness deal that you're supposed to ask me how I think you can be of help? Cause I've been through this before. You haven't asked what I want. Isn't it? Well how about either give me ECT2929 again or give me my belt back. Because I can't stand feeling like this another second and the seconds keep coming on and on.’ 'Well' the doctor said slowly nodding to indicate he had heard the feelings the young woman was expressing 'Well I'm happy to discuss treatment options with you Katherine. But I have to say right now I'm curious about what you started it sounded like to me to maybe start to indicate what might have occurred something two weeks ago to make you feel these feelings now. Would you be comfortable talking to me about it?’ 'Either ECT or you could just sedate me for a month. You could do that. All I'd need is I think a month at the outside. Like a controlled coma. You could do that if you guys want to help.’ The doctor gazed at her with a patience she was meant to see. And she gave him back a frightening smile a smile empty of all affect as if someone had contracted her circumorals with a thigmotactic electrode. The teeth of the smile evidenced a clinical depressive's classic inattention to oral hygiene. She said 'I was thinking I was about to say you'll think I'm crazy if I tell you. But then I remembered where I am.' She made a small sound that was supposed to be laughter; it did sound jagged dentate. 'I was going to say I've thought sometimes before like the feeling maybe had to do with Hope.’ 'Hope.’ Her arms had been crossed over her breasts the whole time and though the room was overheated the patient rubbed each palm continually over her upper arms behavior one associates with chill. The position and movement shielded her inner arms from view. The doctor's eyebrows had gone synclinal from puzzlement without his awareness. 'Bob.’ 'Bob.' The doctor was anxious that his failure to have any idea what the girl was referring to would betray itself and accentuate her feelings of loneliness and psychic pain. Classic unipolars were usually tormented by the conviction that no one else could hear or understand them when they tried to communicate. Hence jokes sarcasm the psychopathology of unconscious armrubbing. Kate Gompert's head was rolling like a blind person's. 'Jesus what am I doing here. Bob Hope. Dope. Sinse. Stick. Grass. Smoke.' She made a quick duBois-gesture with thumb and finger held to rounded lips. The dealers down where I buy it some of them make you call it Bob Hope when you call in case anybody's accessed the line. You're supposed to ask is Bob in town. And if they have some they say "Hope springs eternal" usually. It's like a code. One kid makes you ask him to please commit a crime. The dealers that stay around any length of time tend to be on the paranoid side. As if it would fool anybody who knew enough to bother to access the band on the call.' She seemed decidedly more animated. 'And one particular guy with snakes in a tank in a trailer in Allston he —’ 'So drugs then you're saying you feel may be a factor' the doctor interrupted. The depressed young woman's face emptied once more. She engaged briefly in something the staffers on Specials called the Thousand-Meter Stare. 'Not "drugs" ' she said slowly. The doctor smelled shame in the room sour and uremic. Her face had become distantly pained now. The girl said: 'Stopping.’ The doctor felt comfortable saying once again that he was not sure he understood what she was trying to share with him. She now went through a series of expressions that made it clinically impossible for the doctor to determine whether or not she was entirely sincere. She looked either pained or trying somehow to suppress hilarity. She said 'I don't know if you'll believe me. I'm worried you'll think I'm crazy. I have this thing with pot.’ 'Meaning marijuana.’ The doctor was oddly sure that Kate Gompert pretended to sniff instead of engaging in a real sniff. 'Marijuana. Most people think of marijuana as just some minor substance I know just like this natural plant that happens to make you feel good the way poison oak makes you itch and if you say you're in trouble with Hope — people'll just laugh. Because there's much worse drugs out there. Believe me I know.’ 'I'm not laughing at you Katherine' the doctor said and meant it. 'But I love it so much. Sometimes it's like the center of my life. It does something to me I know that's not good and I got told point-blank not to smoke on the Parnate because Dr. Garton said no one knew what certain combinations do yet and it'd be roulette. But after a while I always think to myself it's been a while and things will be different somehow this time if I do even on the Parnate so I do again I start again. I'll start out doing just like a couple of hits off a duBois after work to get me through dinner because dinner with my mother and me is — well but and pretty soon after a while I'm in my room with the fan pointed out the window all night doing one-hitters and exhaling at the fan to kill the smell and I make her say I'm not there if anybody calls and I lie about what I'm doing in there all night even if she doesn't ask sometimes she asks and sometimes she doesn't. And then after a while I'm smoking joints at work at breaks going in the bathroom and standing on the toilet and blowing it out the window there's this tiny window up high with the glass frosted and all filthy and cobwebby and I hate having my face up next to it but if I clean it off I'm afraid Mrs. Diggs or somebody will be able to tell somebody's been doing something up around the window standing there in high heels on the rim of the toilet brushing my teeth all the time and using up Collyrium3030 by the bottleful and switching the console to audio and always needing more water before I answer the console because my mouth's too dry to talk especially on the Parnate the Parnate makes my mouth dry anyways. And pretty soon I'm totally paranoid they know I'm stoned at work sitting there in the office high reeking and I'm the only one that can't tell I reek I'm like so obsessed with Do They Know Can They Tell and then after a while I'm having my mother call in sick for me so I can stay home after she goes in to work and have the whole place to myself with nobody to worry about Do They Know and smoke out the fan and spray Lysol all over and stir Ginger's litter box around so the whole place reeks of Ginger and smoke and draw and watch terrible daytime stuff on the TP because I don't want my mother to see any cartridge-orders on days I'm supposed to be in bed sick I start to get obsessed with Does She Know. I'm getting more and more miserable and fed up with myself for smoking so much this is after a couple weeks of it is all and I start getting high and thinking about nothing except how I have to quit smoking all this Bob so I can get back to work and start saying I'm here when people call so I can start living some kind of damn life instead of just sitting around in pajamas pretending I'm sick like a third-grader and smoking and watching TP again and so after I've smoked the last of whatever I've got I always say No More This Is It and I throw out my papers and my one-hitter I've probably thrown about fifty one-hitters in dumpsters including some nice wood and brass ones including a couple from Brazil the land-barge guys must go through our sector's dumpster once a day looking to get another good one-hitter. And anyways I quit. I do stop. I get sick of it I don't like what it does to me. And I go back to work and work my fanny off to make up for the last couple weeks and get a leg up on like building momentum for a whole new start you know?’ The young woman's face and eyes were going through a number of ranges of affective configurations with all of them seeming inexplicably at gut-level somehow blank and maybe not entirely sincere. 'And so' she said 'but then I quit. And a couple of weeks after I've smoked a lot and finally stopped and quit and gone back to really living after a couple of weeks this feeling always starts creeping in just creeping in a little at the edges at first like first thing in the morning when I get up or waiting for the T to go home after work for supper. And I try to deny it the feeling ignore it because I fear it more than anything.’ 'The feeling you're describing that starts creeping in.’ Kate Gompert finally took a real breath. 'And then but no matter what I do it gets worse and worse it's there more and more this filter drops down and the feeling makes the fear of the feeling way worse and after a couple weeks it's there all the time the feeling and I'm totally inside it I'm in it and everything has to pass through it to get in and I don't want to smoke any Bob and I don't want to work or go out or read or watch TP or go out or stay in or either do anything or not do anything I don't want anything except for the feeling to go away. But it doesn't. Part of the feeling is being like willing to do anything to make it go away. Understand that. Anything. Do you understand? It's not wanting to hurt myself it's wanting to not hurt.’ The doctor hadn't even pretended to try to take notes on all this. He couldn't keep himself from trying to determine whether the ambient blank insincerity the patient seemed to project during what appeared clinically to be a significant gamble and move toward trust and self-revealing was in fact projected by the patient or was somehow counter-transferred or -projected onto the patient from the doctor's own psyche out of some sort of anxiety over the critical therapeutic possibilities her revelation of concern over drug-use might represent. The time this thinking required looked like sober and thoughtful consideration of what Kate Gompert said. She was again gazing at her feet's interactions with the empty boating sneakers her face moving between expressions associated with grief and suffering. None of the clinical literature the doctor had read for his psych rotation suggested any relation between unipolar episodes and withdrawal from cannabinoids. 'So this has happened in the past prior to your other hospitalizations then Katherine.’ Her face foreshortened by its downward angle was working in the spread writhing configurations of weeping but no tears emerged. 'I just want you to shock me. Just get me out of this. I'll do anything you want.’ 'Have you explored this possible connection between your cannabis use and your depressions with your regular therapist Katherine?’ She did not respond directly as such. Her associations began to loosen in the doctor's opinion as her face continued to work dryly. 'I had shock before and it got me out of this. Straps. Nurses with their sneakers in little green bags. Anti-saliva injections. Rubber thing for your tongue. General. Just some headaches. I didn't mind it at all. I know everybody thinks it's horrible. That old cartridge Nichols and the big Indian. Distortion. They give you a general here right? They put you under. It's not that bad. I'll go willingly.’ The doctor was summarizing her choice of treatment-option as was her right on her chart. He had extremely good penmanship for a doctor. He put her get me out of this in quotation marks. He was adding his own post-assessment question Then what? when Kate Gompert began weeping for real. And just before Ol45h. on 2 April Y.D.A.U. his wife arrived back home and uncovered her hair and came in and saw the Near Eastern medical attache and his face and tray and eyes and the soiled condition of his special recliner and rushed to his side crying his name aloud touching his head trying to get a response failing to get any response to her he still staring straight ahead; and eventually and naturally she — noting that the expression on his rictus of a face nevertheless appeared very positive ecstatic even you could say — she eventually and naturally turning her head and following his line of sight to the cartridge-viewer. Gerhardt Schtitt Head Coach and Athletic Director at the Enfield Tennis Academy Enfield MA was wooed fiercely by E.T.A. Headmaster Dr. James Incandenza just about begged to come on board the moment the Academy's hilltop was shaved flat and the place was up and running. Incandenza had decided he was going to bring Schtitt on board or bust — this even though Schtitt had then just lately been asked to resign from the staff of a Nick Bollettieri camp in Sarasota because of a really unfortunate incident involving a riding crop. By now though pretty much everybody now at E.T.A. feels as though stories about Schtitt's whole corporal-punitive thing must have been pumped up out of all sane proportion because even though Schtitt still does favor those high and shiny black boots and yes the epaulets still and now a weatherman's telescoping pointer that's a clear stand-in for the now-forbidden old riding crop he has Schtitt at near what must be seventy mellowed to the sort of elder-statesman point where he's become mostly a dispenser of abstractions rather than discipline a philosopher instead of a king. His felt presence is here mostly verbal; the weatherman's pointer has not made corrective contact with even one athletic bottom in Schtitt's whole nine years at E.T.A. Still although he now has all these Lebensgefährtins3131 and prorectors to administer most of the necessary little characterbuilding cruelties Schtitt does like his occasional bit of fun still. So but when Schtitt dons the leather helmet and goggles and revs up the old F.R.G.-era BMW cycle and trails the sweating E.T.A. squads up the Comm. Ave. hills into East Newton on their P.M. conditioning runs making judicious use of his pea-shooter to discourage straggling sluggards it's usually eighteen-year-old Mario Incandenza who gets to ride along in the sidecar carefully braced and strapped the wind blowing his thin hair straight back off his oversized head beaming and waving his claw at people he knows. It's possibly odd that the leptosomatic Mario I. so damaged he can't even grip a stick much less flail at a moving ball with one is the one kid at E.T.A. whose company Schtitt seeks out is in fact pretty much the one person with whom Schtitt speaks candidly lets his pedagogical hair down. He's not close to his prorectors particularly Schtitt and treats Aubrey deLint and Mary Esther Thode with a formality that's almost parodic. But often of a warm evening sometimes Mario and Coach Schtitt will find themselves out alone under the East Courts' canvas pavilion or the towering copper beech west of Comm.-Ad. or at one of the initial-scarred redwood picnic tables off the path out behind the Headmaster's House where Mario's mother and uncle live Schtitt savoring a post-prandial pipe Mario enjoying the smells of the calliopsis alongside the grounds' quincunx paths the sweetish pines and the briers' yeasty musk coming up from the hillside's slopes. And he actually likes the sulphury odor of Schtitt's obscure Austrian blend. Schtitt talks Mario listens generally. Mario is basically a born listener. One of the positives to being visibly damaged is that people can sometimes forget you're there even when they're interfacing with you. You almost get to eavesdrop. It's almost like they're like: If nobody's really in there there's nothing to be shy about. That's why bullshit often tends to drop away around damaged listeners deep beliefs revealed diary-type private reveries indulged out loud; and listening the beaming and brady-kinetic boy gets to forge an interpersonal connection he knows only he can truly feel here. Schtitt has the sort of creepy wiriness of old men who still exercise vigorously. He has surprised blue eyes and a vivid white crewcut of the sort that looks virile and good on men who have lost a lot of hair anyway. And skin so clean-sheet-white it almost glows; an evident immunity to the sun's UV; in pine-shaded twilight he is almost glowingly white as if cut from the stuff of moons. He has a way of focusing his whole self's concentration very narrowly adjusting his legs' spread for the varicoceles and curling one arm over the other and sort of drawing himself in around the pipe he attends to. Mario can sit motionless for really long periods. When Schtitt exhales pipe-smoke in different geometric shapes they both seem to study intently when Schtitt exhales he makes little sounds variant in plosivity between P and B. 'Am realizing whole myth of efficiency and no waste that is making this continent of countries we are in.' He exhales. 'You know myths?’ 'Is that like a story?’ 'Ach. A made-up story. For some children. An efficiency of Euclid only: flat. For flat children. Straight ahead! Plow ahead! Go! This is myth.’ 'There aren't any flat children really.’ 'This myth of the competition and bestness we fight for you players here: this myth: they assume here always the efficient way is to plow in straight go! The story that the shortest way between two places is the straight line yes?’ 'Yes?’ Schtitt can use the stem of the pipe to point for emphasis: 'But what then when something is in the way when you go between places no? Plow ahead: go: collide: kabong.’ 'Willikers!’ 'Where is their straight shortest then yes? Where is the efficiently quickly straight of Euclid then yes? And how many two places are there without there is something in the way between them if you go?’ It can be entertaining to watch the evening pines' mosquitoes light and feed deeply on luminous Schtitt who is oblivious. The smoke doesn't keep them away. 'When I am boyish training to compete for best our training facilities on a sign very largely painted stated WE ARE WHAT WE WALK BETWEEN.’ 'Gosh.’ It's a tradition one stemming maybe from Wimbledon's All-England locker rooms' tympana that every big-time tennis academy has its own special traditional motto on the wall in the locker rooms some special aphoristic nugget that's supposed to describe and inform what the academy's philosophy's all about. After Mario's father Dr. Incandenza passed away the new Headmaster Dr. Charles Tavis a Canadian citizen either Mrs. Incandenza's half-brother or adoptive brother depending on the version C.T. had taken down Incandenza's founding motto — TE OCCIDERE POSSUNT SED TE EDERE NON POSSUNT NEFAS EST3232 — and had replaced it with the rather more upbeat THE MAN WHO KNOWS HIS LIMITATIONS HAS NONE. Mario is an enormous fan of Gerhardt Schtitt whom most of the other E.T.A. kids regard as probably bats and as w/o doubt mind-looseningly discursive and show the old pundit even token respect mostly because Schtitt still personally oversees the daily drill-assignments and can if aggrieved have Thode and deLint make them extremely uncomfortable more or less at will out there in A.M. practice. One of the reasons the late James Incandenza had been so terribly high on bringing Schtitt to E.T.A. was that Schtitt like the founder himself (who'd come back to tennis and later film from a background in hard-core-math-based optical science) was that Schtitt approached competitive tennis more like a pure mathematician than a technician. Most jr.-tennis coaches are basically technicians hands-on practical straight-ahead problem-solving statistical-data wonks with maybe added knacks for short-haul psychology and motivational speaking. The point about not crunching serious stats is that Schtitt had clued Incandenza in all the way back at a B.S. 19893333 U.S.T.A. convention on photoelectric line-judging that he Schtitt knew real tennis was really about not the blend of statistical order and expansive potential that the game's technicians revered but in fact the opposite — not-order limit the places where things broke down fragmented into beauty. That real tennis was no more reducible to delimited factors or probability curves than chess or boxing the two games of which it's a hybrid. In short Schtitt and the tall A.E.G.-optics man (i.e. Incandenza) whose fierce flat serve-and-haul-ass-to-the-net approach to the game had carried him through M.I.T. on a full ride w/ stipend and whose consulting report on high-speed photoelectric tracking the U.S.T.A. mucky-mucks found dense past all comprehending found themselves totally simpatico on tennis's exemption from stats-tracking regression. Were he now still among the living Dr. Incandenza would now describe tennis in the paradoxical terms of what's now called 'Extra-Linear Dynamics.'3434 And Schtitt whose knowledge of formal math is probably about equivalent to that of a Taiwanese kindergartner nevertheless seemed to know what Hopman and van der Meer and Bollettieri seemed not to know: that locating beauty and art and magic and improvement and keys to excellence and victory in the prolix flux of match play is not a fractal matter of reducing chaos to pattern. Seemed intuitively to sense that it was a matter not of reduction at all but — perversely — of expansion the aleatory flutter of uncontrolled metastatic growth — each well-shot ball admitting of n possible responses n2 possible responses to those responses and on into what Incandenza would articulate to anyone who shared both his backgrounds as a Cantorian3535 continuum of infinities of possible move and response Cantorian and beautiful because wfoliating contained this diagnate infinity of infinities of choice and execution mathematically uncontrolled but humanly contained bounded by the talent and imagination of self and opponent bent in on itself by the containing boundaries of skill and imagination that brought one player finally down that kept both from winning that made it finally a game these boundaries of self. 'You mean like the baselines are boundaries?' Mario tries to ask. 'Lieber Gott nein' with a plosive disgusted sound. Schtitt likes best of all smoke-shapes to try to blow rings and is kind of lousy at it blowing mostly wobbly lavender hot dogs which Mario finds delightful. The thing with Schtitt: like most Europeans of his generation anchored from infancy to certain permanent values which — yes OK granted — may admittedly have a whiff of proto-fascist potential about them but which do nevertheless (the values) anchor nicely the soul and course of a life — Old World patriarchal stuff like honor and discipline and fidelity to some larger unit — Gerhardt Schtitt does not so much dislike the modern O.N.A.N.ite U.S. of A. as find it hilarious and frightening at the same time. Probably mostly just alien. This should not be rendered in exposition like this but Mario Incandenza has a severely limited range of verbatim recall. Schtitt was educated in pre-Unification Gymnasium under the rather Kanto-Hegelian idea that jr. athletics was basically just training for citizenship that jr. athletics was about learning to sacrifice the hot narrow imperatives of the Self — the needs the desires the fears the multiform cravings of the individual appetitive will — to the larger imperatives of a team (OK the State) and a set of delimiting rules (OK the Law). It sounds almost frighteningly simple-minded though not to Mario across the redwood table listening. By learning in palestra the virtues that pay off directly in competitive games the welldisciplined boy begins assembling the more abstract gratification-delaying skills necessary for being a 'team player' in a larger arena: the even more subtly diffracted moral chaos of full-service citizenship in a State. Except Schtitt says Ach but who can imagine this training serving its purpose in an experialist and waste-exporting nation that's forgotten privation and hardship and the discipline which hardship teaches by requiring? A U.S. of modern A. where the State is not a team or a code but a sort of sloppy intersection of desires and fears where the only public consensus a boy must surrender to is the acknowledged primacy of straight-line pursuing this flat and short-sighted idea of personal happiness: The happy pleasure of the person alone yes?’ 'Except why do you let deLint tie Pemulís and Shaw's shoes to the lines if the lines aren't boundaries?’ 'Without there is something bigger. Nothing to contain and give the meaning. Lonely. Verstiegenheit.'3636 'Bless you.’ 'Any something. The what: this is more unimportant than that there is something.’ Schtitt one time was telling Mario as they respectively walked and tottered down Comm. Ave. eastward into Allston to see about getting a gourmet ice cream someplace along there that when he was Mario's age — or maybe more like Hal's age whatever — he (Schtitt) had once fallen in love with a tree a willow that from a certain humid twilit perspective had looked like a mysterious woman aswirl with gauze this certain tree in the public Platz of some West German town whose name sounded to Mario like the sound of somebody strangling. Schtitt reported being seriously smitten with the tree: 'I went daily to there to be with the tree.’ They respectively walked and tottered ice-cream-bound Mario moving like the one of them who was truly old mind off his stride because he was trying to think hard about what Schtitt believed. Mario's thinking-hard expression resembles what for another person would be the sort of comically distorted face made to amuse an infant. He was trying to think how to articulate some reasonable form of a question like: But then how does this surrender-the-personal-individual-wants-to-the-larger-State-orbeloved- tree-or-something stuff work in a deliberately individual sport like competitive junior tennis where it's just you v. one other guy? And then also again still what are those boundaries if they're not baselines that contain and direct its infinite expansion inward that make tennis like chess on the run beautiful and infinitely dense? Schtitt's thrust and his one great irresistible attraction in the eyes of Mario's late father: The true opponent the enfolding boundary is the player himself. Always and only the self out there on court to be met fought brought to the table to hammer out terms. The competing boy on the net's other side: he is not the foe: he is more the partner in the dance. He is the what is the word excuse or occasion for meeting the self. As you are his occasion. Tennis's beauty's infinite roots are self-competitive. You compete with your own limits to transcend the self in imagination and execution. Disappear inside the game: break through limits: transcend: improve: win. Which is why tennis is an essentially tragic enterprise to improve and grow as a serious junior with ambitions. You seek to vanquish and transcend the limited self whose limits make the game possible in the first place. It is tragic and sad and chaotic and lovely. All life is the same as citizens of the human State: the animating limits are within to be killed and mourned over and over again. Mario thinks of a steel pole raised to double its designed height and clips his shoulder on the green steel edge of a dumpster pirouetting halfway to the cement before Schtitt darts in to catch him and it almost looks like they're doing a dance-floor dip as Schtitt says this game the players are all at E.T.A. to learn this infinite system of decisions and angles and lines Mario's brothers worked so brutishly hard to master: junior athletics is but one facet of the real gem: life's endless war against the self you cannot live without. Schtitt then falls into the sort of silence of someone who's enjoying mentally rewinding and replaying what he just came up with. Mario thinks hard again. He's trying to think of how to articulate something like: But then is battling and vanquishing the self the same as destroying yourself? Is that like saying life is pro-death? Three passing Allstonian street-kids mock and make fun of Mario's appearance behind the pair's backs. Some of Mario's thinking-faces are almost orgasmic: fluttery and slack. And then but so what's the difference between tennis and suicide life and death the game and its own end? It's always Schtitt who ends up experimenting with some exotic icecream flavor when they arrive. Mario always chickens out and opts for good old basic chocolate when the moment of decision at the counter comes. Thinking along the lines of like Better the flavor you know for sure you already love. 'And so. No different maybe' Schtitt concedes sitting up straight on a waffle-seated aluminum chair with Mario beneath an askew umbrella that makes the flimsy little table it's rooted to shake and clank in the sidewalk's breeze. 'Maybe no different so' biting hard into his tricolored cone. He feels at the side of his white jaw where there's some sort of red welt it looks like. 'Not different' — looking out into the Ave.'s raised median at the Green Line train rattling past downhill — 'except the chance to play.' He brightens in preparation to laugh in his startling German roar saying 'No? Yes? The chance to play yes?' And Mario loses a dollop of chocolate down his chin because he has this involuntary thing where he laughs whenever anyone else does and Schtitt is finding what he has just said very amusing indeed. YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT There is no jolly irony in Tiny Ewell's name. He is tiny an elf-sized U.S. male. His feet barely reach the floor of the taxi. He is seated being driven east into the grim three-decker districts of East Watertown west of Boston proper. A rehabilitative staffer wearing custodial whites under a bombardier's jacket sits beside Tiny Ewell big arms crossed and staring placid as a cow at the intricately creased back of the cabbie's neck. The window Tiny is next to has a sticker that thanks him in advance for not smoking. Tiny Ewell wears no winter gear over a jacket and tie that don't quite go together and stares out his window with unplacid intensity at the same district he grew up in. He normally takes involved routes to avoid Watertown. His jacket a 26S his slacks a 26/24 his shirt one of the shirts his wife had so considerately packed for him to bring into the hospital detox and hang on hangers that won't leave the rod. As with all Tiny Ewell's business shirts only the front and cuffs are ironed. He wears size 6 Florsheim wingtips that gleam nicely except for one big incongruous scuff-mark of white from where he'd kicked at his front door when he'd returned home just before dawn from an extremely important get-together with potential clients to find that his wife had had the locks changed and filed a restraining order and would communicate with him only by notes passed through the mail-slot below the white door's black brass (the brass had been painted black) knocker. When Tiny leans down and wipes at the scuff-mark with a slim thumb it only pales and smears. It is Tiny's first time out of Happy Slippers since his second day at the detox. They took away his Florsheims after 24 abstinent hours had passed and he started to perhaps D.T. a little. He'd kept noticing mice scurrying around his room mice as in rodents vermin and when he lodged a complaint and demanded the room be fumigated at once and then began running around hunched and pounding with the heel of a hand-held Florsheim at the mice as they continued to ooze through the room's electrical outlets and scurry repulsively about eventually a gentle-faced nurse flanked by large men in custodial whites negotiated a trade of shoes for Librium predicting that the mild sedative would fumigate what really needed to be fumigated. They gave him slippers of green foam-rubber with smiley-faces embossed on the tops. The detox's in-patients are encouraged to call these Happy Slippers. The staff refer to the footwear in private as 'pisscatchers.' It is Tiny Ewell's first day out of rubber slippers and ass-exposing detox pajamas and striped cotton robe in two weeks. The early-November day is foggy and colorless. The sky and the street are the same color. The trees look skeletal. There is bright wet wadded litter all along the seams of street and curb. The houses are skinny three-deckers mashed together wharf-gray w/ salt-white trim madonnas in the yards bowlegged dogs hurling themselves against the fencing. Some schoolboys in knee-pads and skallycaps are playing street hockey on a passing school's cement playground. Except none of the boys seems to be moving. The trees' bony fingers make spell-casting gestures in the wind as they pass. East Watertown is the obvious straight-line easement between St. Mel's detox and the halfway house's Enfield and Ewell's insurance is paying for the cab. With his small round shape and bit of white goatee and a violent flush that could pass for health of some jolly sort Tiny Ewell looks like a radically downscaled Burl Ives the late Burl Ives as an impossible bearded child. Tiny looks out the window at the rose window of the church next to the school playground where the boys are playing/not playing. The rose window is not illuminated from either side. The man who for the last three days has been Tiny Ewell's roommate at St. Mel's Hospital's detoxification unit sits in a blue plastic straight-back chair in front of his and Ewell's room's window's air conditioner watching it. The air conditioner hums and gushes and the man gazes with rapt intensity into its screen of horizontal vents. The air conditioner's cord is thick and white and leads into a three-prong outlet with black heel-marks on the wall all around it. The November room is around 12° C. The man turns the air conditioner's dial from setting #4 to setting #5. The curtains above it shake and billow around the window. The man's face falls into and out of amused expressions as he watches the air conditioner. He sits in the blue chair with a trembling Styrofoam cup of coffee and a paper plate of brownies into which he taps ashes from the cigarettes whose smoke the air conditioner blows straight back over his head. The cigarette smoke is starting to pile up against the wall behind him and to ooze and run chilled down the wall and form a sort of cloud-bank near the floor. The man's raptly amused profile appears in the mirror on the wall beside the dresser the two in-patients share. The man like Tiny Ewell has the rouged-corpse look that attends detox from late-stage alcoholism. The man is in addition a burnt-yellow beneath his flush from chronic hepatitis. The mirror he appears in is treated with shatterproof Lucite polymers. The man leans carefully forward with the plate of brownies in his lap and changes the setting on the air conditioner from 5 to 3 and then to 7 then 8 scanning the screen of gushing vents. He finally turns the selector's dial all the way around to 9. The air conditioner roars and blows his long hair straight back and his beard blows back over his shoulder ashes fly and swirl around from his plate of brownies plus crumbs and his rodney's tip glows cherry and gives sparks. He is deeply engaged by whatever he sees on 9. He gives Tiny Ewell the screaming meemies Ewell has complained. He wears pisscatchers a striped cotton St. Mel's robe and a pair of glasses missing one lens. He has been watching the air conditioner all day. His face produces the little smiles and grimaces of a person who's being thoroughly entertained. When the big black rehabilitative staffer placed Tiny Ewell in the taxi and then squeezed in and told the cabbie they wanted Unit #6 in the Enfield Marine VA Hospital Complex just off Commonwealth Ave. in Enfield the cabbie whose photo was on the Mass. Livery License taped to the glove compartment the cabbie looking back and down at little Tiny Ewell's neat white beard and ruddy complexion and sharp threads had scratched under his skallycap and asked if he was sick or something. Tiny Ewell had said 'So it would seem.’ By mid-afternoon on 2 April Y.D.A.U.: the Near Eastern medical attache; his devout wife; the Saudi Prince Q---------'s personal physician's personal assistant who'd been sent over to see why the medical attache hadn't appeared at the Back Bay Hilton in the a.m. and then hadn't answered his beeper's page; the personal physician himself who'd come to see why his personal assistant hadn't come back; two Embassy security guards w/ sidearms who'd been dispatched by a candidiatic heartily pissed-off Prince Q---------; and two neatly groomed Seventh Day Adventist pamphleteers who'd seen human heads through the living room window and found the front door unlocked and come in with all good spiritual intentions — all were watching the recursive loop the medical attache had rigged on the TP's viewer the night before sitting and standing there very still and attentive looking not one bit distressed or in any way displeased even though the room smelled very bad indeed. 30 APRIL — YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT He sat alone above the desert redly backlit and framed in shale watching very yellow payloaders crawl over the beaten dirt of some U.S.A. construction site several km. to the southeast. The outcropping's height allowed him Marathe to look out over most of U.S.A. area code 6026. His shadow did not yet reach the downtown regions of the city Tucson; not yet quite. Of sounds in the arid hush were only a faint and occasional hot wind the blurred sound of the wings of sometimes an insect some tentative trickling of loosened grit and small stones moving farther down the upslope behind. And as well the sunset over the foothills and mountains behind him: such a difference from the watery and somehow sad spring sunsets of southwestern Quebec's Papineau regions where his wife had need of care. This (the sunset) more resembled an explosion. It took place above and behind him and he turned some of the time to regard it: it (the sunset) was swollen and perfectly round and large radiating knives of light when he squinted. It hung and trembled slightly like a viscous drop about to fall. It hung just above the peaks of the Tortolita foothills behind him (Marathe) and slowly was sinking. Marathe sat alone and blanket-lapped in his customized fauteuil de roll-ent3737on a kind of outcropping or shelf about halfway up waiting amusing himself with his shadow. As the lowering light from behind came at an angle more and more acute Goethe's well-known 'Bröckengespensf phenomenon3838 enlarged and distended his seated shadow far out overland so that the spokes of his chair's rear wheels cast over two whole counties below gigantic asterisk-shadows whose fine black radial lines he could cause to move by playing slightly with the wheels' rubber rims; and his head's shadow brought to much of the suburb West Tucson a premature dusk. He appeared to remain concentrated on his huge shadow-play as gravel and then also breath sounded from the steep hillside back above him grit and dirty stones cascading onto the outcropping and gushing past his chair and off the front lip and then the unmistakable yelp of an individual's impact with a cactus somewhere up behind. But Marathe he had all the time without turning watched the other man's clumsy sliding descent's own mammoth shadow cast as far east as the Rincon range just past the city Tucson and could see the shadow rush in west toward his own as Unspecified Services' M. Hugh Steeply descended falling twice and cursing in U.S.A. English until the shadow collapsed nearly into Marathe's monstrous own. Another yelp took place as the Unspecified Services field-operative's fall and slide the last several meters carried him upon his bottom down onto the outcropping and then nearly all the way out and off it Marathe having to release the machine pistol under his blanket to grab Steeply's bare arm and halt this sliding. Steeply's skirt was pulled obscenely up and his hosiery full of runs and stubs of thorns. The operative sat at Marathe's feet glowing redly in the backlight legs hanging over the shelf's edge breathing with difficulty. Marathe smiled and released the operative's arm. 'Stealth becomes you' he said. 'Go shit in your chapeau' Steeply wheezed bring up his legs to survey the hosiery's damage. They spoke for the most part U.S.A. English when they met like this covertly in the field. M. Fortier3939 had wished Marathe to require that they interface always in Québecois French as for a small symbolic concession to the A.F.R. on the part of the Office of Unspecified Services which the Québecois Sepératiste Left referred to always as B.S.S. the 'Bureau des Services sans Spécificité.’ Marathe watched a column of shadow spread again out east over the desert's floor as Steeply got a hand under himself and rose a huge and well-fed figure tottering on heels. The two men sent together a strange Bröckengespenst-shndow out toward the city Tucson a shadow round and radial at the base and jagged at the top from Steeply's wig becoming uncombed in his descent. Steeply's gigantic prosthetic breasts pointed in wildly different directions now one nearly at the empty sky. The matte curtain of sunset's true dusk-shadow was moving itself very slowly in across the Rin-cons and Sonora desert east of the city Tucson still many km. from obscuring their own large shadow. But once Marathe had committed not just to pretend to betray his Assassins des Fauteuils Rollents in order to secure advanced medical care for the medical needs of his wife but to in truth do this — betray perfidiously: now pretending only to M. Fortier and his A.F.R. superiors that he was merely pretending to feed some betraying information to B.S.S.4040 — once this decision Marathe was without all power served now at the pleasures of the power of Steeply and the B.S.S. of Hugh Steeply: and now they spoke mostly the U.S.A. English of Steeply's preference. In fact Steeply's Québecois was better than Marathe's English but c'était la guerre as one says. Marathe sniffed slightly. 'Thus so we now are both here.' He wore a windbreaker and did not perspire. Steeply's eyes were luridly made up. The rear area of his dress was dirty. Some of his makeup had started to run. He was forming a type of salute to shade his eyes and looking upward behind them at what remained of the explosive and trembling sun. 'How in God's name did you get up here?’ Marathe slowly shrugged. As usual he appeared to Steeply as if he were half-asleep. He ignored the question and said only shrugging 'My time is finite.’ Steeply had also with him a woman's handbag or purse. 'And the wife?' he said gazing upward as yet. 'How's the wife doing?’ 'Holding her own weight thank you' Marathe said. His tone of his voice betrayed nothing. 'And so thus what is it your Offices believe they wish to know?’ Steeply tottered on a leg as he removed one shoe and poured from it grit. 'Nothing terribly surprising. A bit of razzle-dazzle up northeast in your so-called Ops-area certainly you heard.’ Marathe sniffed. A large odor of inexpensive and high-alcohol perfume came not from Steeply's person but from his handbag which failed to complement his shoes. Marathe said 'Dazzle?’ 'As in a civilian-type individual receives a certain item. Don't tell me this is news to you guys. Not on InterLace pulse this item. Arrives via normal physical mail. We're sure you heard Rémy. A cartridge-copy of a certain let's call it between ourselves "the Entertainment." As in in the mail without warning or motive. Out of the blue.’ 'From somewhere blue?’ The B.S.S. operative had perspired also through his rouge and his mascara had melted to become whorish. 'A person with no political value to anybody except that the Saudi Ministry of Entertainment made one the hell of a shrill stink.’ 'The medical attache the specialist of digesting you refer to.' Marathe shrugged again in that maddening Francophone way that can mean several things. 'Your offices wish to ask was the Entertainment's cartridge disseminated through our mechanisms?’ 'Don't let's waste your finite time ami old friend' Steeply said. 'The mischief happens to occur in metropolitan Boston. Postal codes route the package through the desert Southwest and we know your dissemination-scheme's routing mechanism is proposed for somewhere between Phoenix and the border down here.' Steeply had worked hard at feminizing his expressions and gesturing. 'It would be a bit starry-eyed of O.U.S. not to think of your distinguished cell no?’ Beneath Marathe's windbreaker was a sportshirt whose breast pocket was filled with many pens. He said: 'Us we don't have the information on even casualties. From this blue dazzle you speak of.’ Steeply was trying to extract something stubborn from inside his other shoe. 'Upwards of twenty Rémy. Out of commission altogether. The attache and his wife the wife a Saudi citizen. Four more raggers all with embassy cards. Couple neighbors or something. The rest mostly police before word got to a level they could stop police from going in before they killed the power.’ 'Local police forces. Gendarmes.’ 'The local constabulary.’ 'The minions of the law of the land.’ 'The local constabulary were shall we say unprepared for an Entertainment like this.' Steeply even removed and replaced his pumps in the upright-on-one-leg-bringing-other-foot-up-behind-his-bottom way of a feminine U.S.A. woman. But he appeared huge and bloated as a woman not merely unattractive but inducing something like sexual despair. He said 'The attaché had diplomatic status Rémy. Mideast. Saudi. Said to be close to minor members of the royal family.’ Marathe sniffed hard as if congested of the nose. 'A puzzling' he said. 'But also a compatriot of yours. Canadian citizenship. Born in Ottawa to Arab emigres. Visa lists a residence in Montreal.’ 'And Services Without Specificity wishes maybe to ask were there below-the-surface connections that make the individual not such a civilian unconnected. To ask of us would the A.F.R. wish to make of him the example.’ Steeply was removing dirt from his bottom swatting himself on the bottom. He stood more or less directly over Marathe. Marathe sniffed. 'We have neither digestive medicals nor diplomatic entourages on any lists for action. You have personally seen A.F.R.'s initial lists. Nor in particular Montreal civilians. We have as one will say larger seafood to cook.’ Steeply was looking out over the desert and city also as he swatted at himself. He seemed to have noticed the gespenstphenomenon of his own shadow. Marathe for some reason pretended again to sniff the nose. The wind was moderate and constant and of about the temperature of a U.S.A. clothes-dryer set on Low. It made the shrill whistling sounds. Also sounds of the blowing grit. Weeds-of-tumbling like enormous hairballs rolled often across the Interstate Highway of I-10 far below. Their specular perspective the reddening light on vast tan stone and the oncoming curtain of dusk the further elongation of their monstrous agnate shadows: all was almost mesmerizing. Neither man seemed able to look at anything but the vista below. Marathe could simultaneously speak in English and think in French. The desert was the tawny color of the hide of the lion. Their speaking without looking at one another facing both the same direction — this gave their conversing an air of careless intimacy as of old friends at the cartridge-viewer together or a long-married couple. Marathe thought this as he opened and closed his upheld hand making over the city Tucson a huge and black blossom open itself and close itself. And Steeply raised his bare arms and held them out and crossed them maybe as if signalling for distant aid; this made X's and pedentive V's over much in the city Tucson. 'Still Rémy but born in the hated-by-you Ottawa this civilian attache and connected to a major buyer of trans-grid entertainment. And follow-up out of the Boston offices reports possible indications of the victim's prior possible involvement with the widow of the auteur we both know was responsible for the Entertainment in the first place. The samizdat.’ 'Prior?’ Steeply produced from his handbag Belgian cigarettes of a many-mm. and habitually female type. 'Film director's wife'd taught out at Brandeis where the victim'd done his residency. The husband was on board over at A.E.C. and different agencies' background checks indicated the wife was fucking just about everything with a pulse.' With the slight pause of which Steeply could excel: 'Particularly a Canadian pulse.’ 'Involvement of sexuality is what you are meaning then not politics.’ Steeply said 'This wife herself a Québecer Rémy from L'Islet county — Chief Tine says three years spent on Ottawa's "Personnes Qui On Doit" list. There's such a thing as political sex.’ 'I have said to you all we know. Civilians as individual warnings to O.N.A.N. are not our desire. This is known by you.' Marathe's eyes looked nearly closed. 'And your tits they have become cock-eyed I will tell you. Services Without Specificity they have given you ridiculous tits and now they point differently.’ Steeply looked down at himself. One of the false breasts (surely false: surely they would not go as far as the hormonal Marathe thought) nearly touched the chins of Steeply when his looking down produced his double chins. 'I was asked to secure personal verification is all' he said. 'My general sense at the Office is the brass consider the whole incident a stumper. There're theories and countertheories. There are even antitheories positing error mistaken identity sick hoax.' His shrugging with his hands on the prosthesis appeared not at all Gallic. 'Still: twenty-three human beings lost for all time: that'd be some hoax no?’ Marathe sniffed. 'Asked to verify by our mutual M. Tine? How you call him: "Rod a God"?’ (Rodney Tine Sr. Chief of Unspecified Services acknowledged architect of O.N.A.N. and continental Reconfiguration who held the ear of the White House of U.S.A. and whose stenographer had long doubled as the steno-grapher-cum-jeune-fille-deVendredi of M. DuPlessis former asst. coordinator of the pan-Canadian Resistance and whose passionate ill-disguised attachment (Tine's) to this double-amaneunsis — one Mile. Luria Perec of Lamartine county L'Islet Quebec — gave rise to these questions of the high-level loyalties of Tine whether he 'doubled'4141 for Quebec out of the love for Luria or 'tripled' the loyalties pretending only to divulge secrets while secretly maintaining his U.S.A. fealty against the pull of an irresistible love it was said.) 'The Rémy.' It was clear that Steeply could not fix his breasts' directions without pulling down severely his décolletage which he was shy to do. He produced from his handbag sunglasses and put on the sunglasses. They were embellished with rhinestones and looked absurd. 'Rod the God.’ Marathe forced himself to say nothing of their appearance. Steeply tried with several matches to light a cigarette in the wind. The encroachment of true dusk began to erase his wig's chaotic shadow. Electric lights began to twinkle in the Rincon foothills east of the city. Steeply tried somewhat to cup his body around the match for shelter for the flame. It's a herd of feral hamsters a major herd thundering across the yellow plains of the southern reaches of the Great Concavity in what used to be Vermont raising dust that forms a uremíc-hued cloud with somatic shapes interpretable from as far away as Boston and Montreal. The herd is descended from two domestic hamsters set free by a Watertown NY boy at the beginning of the Experialist migration in the subsidized Year of the Whopper. The boy now attends college in Champaign IL and has forgotten that his hamsters were named Ward and June. The noise of the herd is tornadic locomotival. The expression on the hamsters' whiskered faces is businesslike and implacable — it's that implacable-herd expression. They thunder eastward across pedalferrous terrain that today is fallow denuded. To the east dimmed by the fulvous cloud the hamsters send up is the vivid verdant ragged outline of the annularly overfertilized forests of what used to be central Maine. All these territories are now property of Canada. With respect to a herd of this size please exercise the sort of common sense that come to think of it would keep your thinking man out of the southwest Concavity anyway. Feral hamsters are not pets. They mean business. Wide berth advised. Carry nothing even remotely vegetablish if in the path of a feral herd. If in the path of such a herd move quickly and calmly in a direction perpendicular to their own. If American north not advisable. Move south calmly and in all haste toward some border metropolis — Rome NNY or Glens Falls NNY or Beverly MA say or those bordered points between them at which the giant protective ATHSCME fans atop the hugely convex protective walls of anodized Lucite hold off the drooling and piss-colored bank of teratogenic Concavity clouds and move the bank well back north away jaggedly over your protected head. The heavy-tongued English of Steeply was even more difficult to understand with a cigarette in the mouth. He said 'And you'll of course report this little interface of you and me right back to Fortier.’ Marathe shrugged. ' 'n sûr.’ Steeply got it lit. He was a large and soft man some type of brutal-U.S.-contact-sport athlete now become fat. He appeared to Marathe to look less like a woman than a twisted parody of womanhood. Electrolysis had caused patches of tiny red pimples along his jowls and upper lip. He also held his elbow out the arm holding the match for lighting which is how no woman lights a cigarette who is used to breasts and keeps the lighting elbow in. Also Steeply teetered ungracefully on his pumps' heels on the stone's uneven surface. He never for a moment turned his back completely at Marathe as he stood on the lip of the outcropping. And Marathe had his chair's wheels' clamps now locked down tight and a firm grip on the machine pistol's pebbled grip. Steeply's purse was small and glossy black and the sunglasses he wore had womanly frames with small false jewels at the temples. Marathe believed that something in Steeply enjoyed his grotesque appearance and craved the humiliation of the field-disguises his B.S.S. superiors requested of him. Steeply now looked at him in probability behind the dark glasses. 'And also that I just right now asked you if you'd report it and that you said bien sûr?’ Marathe's laugh had this misfortune to sound false and overhearty whether or not sincere. He made a mustache of his finger pretending for some reason to stifle a need to sneeze. 'You verify this because of why?’ Steeply scratched under the hem of his blonde wig with (stupidly dangerously) the thumb of his hand that held the cigarette. 'Well you are already tripling Rémy aren't you? Or would it be quadrupling. We know Fortier and the A.F.R. know you're here with me now.’ 'But do my brothers on wheels know that you are knowing this that they have sent me to pretend I double?’ Marathe's sidearm a Sterling UL35 9 mm machine pistol with a Mag Na Port silencer did not have a safety. Its fat and texture-of-pebbles grip was hot from Marathe's palm and in turn caused Marathe's palm to perspire beneath the blanket. From Steeply there merely was silence. Marathe said: '. . . have I merely pretended to pretend to pretend to betray.'4242 And the desert U.S.A.'s light had become now sad more than half the round sun gone behind the Tortolitas. Only now the chair's wheels and Steeply's thick legs cast shadows below the dusk-line and these shadows were becoming squat and retreating back up toward the two men. Steeply did a brief pretend-Charleston playing with his legs' shadows. 'Nothing personal. You know that. It's the obsessive caution. Who was it — who once said we get paid to drive ourselves crazy the caution thing? You guys and Tine — your DuPlessis always suspected he tried to hold back on the information he passed sexually to Luria.’ Marathe shrugged hard. 'And abruptly M. DuPlessis has now passed away from life. Under circumstances of almost ridiculous suspicion.' Again with the false-sounding laugh. 'An inept burglary and grippe indeed.’ Both men were silent. Steeply's left arm had on it a nasty mesquite scratch Marathe could observe. Marathe finally glanced at his watch its dial illuminated in his body's shadow. Both men's shadows were now climbing the steep incline returning up to them. 'Me I think that we go about our affairs in a more simple manner than your B.S.S. office. If M. Tine's betrayal were incomplete we of Quebec would be aware.’ 'Because of Luria.’ Marathe pretended to fuss with his blanket rearranging it. 'But yes. The caution. Luria would be aware.’ Steeply stepped gingerly up to the edge and tossed out his cigarette's stub. The wind caught the stub and it soared slightly upward from his hand moving east. Both men were silent until the butt fell and hit the dark mountainside off below them a tiny bloom of orange. Their silence then became contemplative. Something tight in the air between them loosened. Marathe no longer felt the sun on his skull. Dusk settled about them. Steeply had found his triceps' scratch and twisted the flesh of his arm to examine it his rouged lips rounded with concern. YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT Tuesday 3 November Enfield Tennis Academy: a.m. drills shower eat class lab class class eat prescriptive-grammar exam lab/class conditioning run p.m. drills play challenge match play challenge match upper-body circuits in weight room sauna shower slump to locker-room floor w/ other players. '. . . to even realize what they're sitting there feeling is unhappiness? Or to even feel it in the first place?’ 1640h.: the Comm.-Ad. Bldg.'s males' locker room is full of clean upper-classmen in towels after p.m. matches the players' hair wet-combed and shining with Barbicide. Pemulis uses the comb's big-toothed end to get that wide-furrowed look that kids from Allston favor. Hal's own hair tends to look wet-combed even when it's dry. 'So' Jim Troeltsch says looking around. 'So what do you think?’ Pemulis lowers himself to the floor by the sinks leaning up against the cabinet where they keep all the disinfectants. He has this way of looking warily to either side of him before he says anything. 'Was there like a central point to all that Troeltsch?’ 'The exam was talking about the syntax of Tolstoy's sentence not about real unhappy families' Hal says quietly. John Wayne as do most Canadians lifts one leg slightly to fart like the fart was some kind of task standing at his locker waiting for his feet to get dry enough to put on socks. There is a silence. Showerheads dribble on tile. Steam hangs. Distant ghastly sounds from T. Schacht over in one of the stalls off the showers. Everyone stares into the middle distance stunned with fatigue. Michael Pemulis who can stand about ten seconds of communal silence tops clear his throat deeply and sends a loogie up and back into the sink behind him. The plate mirrors caught part of its quivering flight Hal sees. Hal closes his eyes. 'Tired' someone exhales. Ortho Stice and John ('N.R.') Wayne seem less fatigued than detached; they have the really top player's way of shutting the whole neural net down for brief periods staring at the space they took up hooded in silence removed for a moment from the connectedness of all events. 'Right then' Troeltsch says. 'Pop quiz. Pop test-question. Most crucial difference for Leith tomorrow between your historical broadcast TV set and a cartridge-capable TP.’ Disney R. Leith teaches E.T.A.'s History of Entertainment I and II as well as certain high-level esoteric Optics things you needed Permission of Inst. to get into. 'The Cathodeluminescent Panel. No cathode gun. No phosphenic screen. Two to the screen's diagonal width in cm. lines of resolution total.’ 'You mean a high-def. viewer in general or a specifically TP-component viewer?’ 'No analogs' Struck says. 'No snow no faint weird like ghostly double next to UHF images no vertical roll when planes fly over.’ 'Analogs v. digitals.’ 'You referring to broadcast as in network versus a TP or network-plus-cable versus a TP?’ 'Did cable TV use analogs? What like pre-fiber phones?’ 'It's the digitals. Leith has that word he uses for the shift from analogs to digitals. That word he uses about eleven times an hour.’ 'What did pre-fiber phones use exactly?’ 'The old tin-can-and-string principle.' "Seminal." He keeps saying it. "Seminal seminal." 'The biggest advance in home communications since the phone he says.’ 'In home entertainment since the TV itself.’ 'Leith might say the Write-Capable CD for entertainment.’ 'He's hard to pin down if you get him on entertainment qua entertainment.’ 'The Diz'll say use your own judgment' Pemulis says. 'Axford took it last year. He wants an argument made. He'll skewer you if you treat it like there's an obvious answer.’ 'Plus there's the InterLace de-digitizer instead of an antenna with a TP' Jim Struck says squeezing at something behind his ear. Graham ('Yard-guard') Rader is checking his underarm for more hair. Freer and Shaw might be asleep. Stice has pulled his towel down slightly and is fingering the deep red abdominal stripe a jock's waistband leaves. 'Boys I ever become president the first thing to go's elastic.’ Troeltsch pretends to shuffle cards. 'Next item. Next like flash-card. Define acutance. Anybody?’ 'A measure of resolution directly proportional to the resolved ratio of a given pulse's digital code' Hal says. 'The Incster has the last word once again' says Struck. Which invites a chorus: The Halster.’ 'Halorama.’ 'Halation.’ 'Halation' Rader says. 'A halo-shaped exposure-pattern around light sources seen on chemical film at low speed.’ 'That most angelic of distortions.’ Struck says 'We'll be like vying for the seats all around Inc tomorrow.' Hal shuts his eyes: he can see the page of text right there all highlighted all yellowed up. 'He can scan the page rotate it fold the corner down and clean under his nails with it all mentally.’ 'Leave him alone' Pemulis says. Freer opens his eyes. 'Do a dictionary-page for us man Inc.’ Stice says 'Leave him be.’ It's all only half-nasty. Hal is placid about getting his balls smacked around; they all are. He does his share of chops-busting. Some of the littler kids who take their showers after the upperclassmen are hanging around listening. Hal sits on the floor quiescent chin on his chest just thinking it's nice finally to breathe and get enough air. The temperature had fallen with the sun. Marathe listened to the cooler evening wind roll across the incline and desert floor. Marathe could sense or feel many million floral pores begin slowly to open hopeful of dew. The American Steeply produced small exhalations between his teeth as he examined his scratch of the arm. Only one or two remaining tips of the digitate spikes of the radial blades of the sun found crevices between the Tortolitas' peaks and probed at the roof of the sky. There were the slight and dry locationless rustlings of small living things that wish to come out at night emerging. The sky was violet. Everyone in the locker room's got a towel around his waist like a kilt. Everyone except Stice has a white E.T.A. towel; Stice uses his own sort of trademark towels black ones. After a silence Stice shoots some air out through his nose. Jim Struck picks liberally at his face and neck. There are one or two sighs. Peter Beak and Evan Ingersoll and Kent Blott twelve eleven ten are up sitting on the blond-wood benches that run in front of the lockers' rows sitting there in towels elbows on knees not taking part. So is Zoltan Csikzentmihalyi who's sixteen but speaks very little English. Idris Arslanian new this year ethnically vague fourteen all feet and teeth is a shadowy lurking presence just outside the locker-room door poking the non-Caucasoid snout in occasionally and then withdrawing terribly shy. Each E.T.A. player in 18-and-Unders has like four to six 14-and-Unders kids he's supposed to keep his more experienced wing over look out for. The more the E.T.A. administration trusts you the younger and more generally clueless the little kids in your charge. Charles Tavis instituted the practice and calls it the Big Buddy System in the literature he sends new kids' parents. So the parents can feel their kid's not getting lost in the institutional shuffle. Beak Blott and Arslanian are all in Hal's Big Buddy group for Y.D.A.U. He also in effect has Ingersoll having traded Todd ('Postal-Weight') Possalthwaite to Axford off the books for Ingersoll because Trevor Axford found he so despised the Ingersoll kid for some unanalyzable reason that he was struggling against a horrible compulsion to put Inger-soll's little fingers into the gap by the hinges of an open door and then very slowly close the door and came to Hal almost in tears Axford had. Though technically Ingersoll is still Axford's and Possalthwaite Hal's. Possalthwaite the great lobber has a weird young-old face and little wet lips that lapse into a sucking reflex under stress. In theory a Big Buddy's somewhere between an R.A. and a prorector. He's there to answer questions ease bumpy transitions show ropes act as liaison with Tony Nwangi and Tex Watson and the other prorectors specializing in little kids. Be somebody they can come to off the record. A shoulder to climb up on a footstool and cry on. If a 16- and-Under gets made a Big Buddy it's kind of an honor; it means they think you're going places. When there's no tournament or travel etc. Big Buddies get together with their quar-to-sextet in small-group private twice a week in the interval between P.M. challenge matches and dinner usually after saunas and showers and a few minutes of sitting slumped around the locker room sucking air. Sometimes Hal sits with his Little Buddies at dinner and eats with them. Not often however. The savvier Big Buddies don't get too overly close with their L.B. ephebes don't let them forget about the unbridgeable gaps of experience and ability and general status that separate ephebes from upperclassmen who've hung in and stuck it out at E.T.A. for years and years. Gives them more to look up to. The savvy Big Buddy doesn't rush in or tread heavy; he holds his own ground and lets the suppliants realize when they need his help and come to him. You have to know when to tread in and take an active hand and when to hang back and let the littler kids learn from the personal experience they'll have to learn from inevitably if they want to be able to hang. Every year the biggest source of attrition besides graduating 18s is 13-15s who've had enough and just can't hang. This happens; the administration accepts it; not everyone's cut out for what's required of you here. Though C.T. makes his administrative assistant Lateral Alice Moore drive the prorectors bats trying to ferret out data on littler kids' psychic states so he can forecast probable burnouts and attritive defections so he'll know how many slots he and Admissions'll have to offer Incomings for the next term. Big Buddies are in a tricky position requested to keep the prorectors generally informed about who among their charges seems shaky in terms of resolve capacity for suffering and stress physical punishment homesickness deep fatigue but at the same time wanting to remain a trustworthy confidential shoulder and wing for their Little Buddies' most private and delicate issues. Though he too has to struggle with a strange urge to be cruel to Inger-soll who reminds him of someone he dislikes but can't quite place Hal on the whole rather likes being a Big B. He likes being there to come to and likes delivering little unpretentious minilectures on tennis theory and E.T.A. pedagogy and tradition and getting to be kind in a way that costs him nothing. Sometimes he finds out he believes something that he doesn't even know he believed until it exits his mouth in front of five anxious little hairless plump trusting clueless faces. The twice-weekly (more like once-weekly as things usually pan out) group interfaces with his quintet are unpleasant only after a particularly bad p.m. session on the courts when he's tired and on edge and would far rather go off by himself and do secret stuff in underground ventilated private. Jim Troeltsch feels at his glands. John Wayne is of the sock-and-a-shoe sock-and-a-shoe school. 'Tired' Ortho Slice again sighs. He pronounces it 'tard.' To a man now the upperclassmen are down slumped on the locker room's blue crush carpet their legs straight out in front of them toes pointing out at that distinctive morgue-angle their backs up against the blue steel of the lockers careful to avoid the six sharp little louvered antimildew vents at each locker's base. All of them look a bit silly naked because of their tennis tans: legs and arms the deep sienna of a quality catcher's mitt from the summer the tan just now this late starting to fade but feet and ankles of toadbelly-white the white of the grave with chests and shoulders and upper arms more like off-white — the players can sit shirtless in the stands at tournaments when they're not playing and get at least a bit of thoracic sun. The faces are the worst maybe most red and shiny some still deep-peeling from three straight weeks of outdoor tournaments in August-September. Besides Hal who's atavistically dark-complected anyway the ones here with the least bad piebald coloring are the players who can tolerate spraying themselves down with Lemon Pledge before outdoor play. It turns out Lemon Pledge when it's applied in pre-play stasis and allowed to dry to a thin crust is a phenomenal sunscreen UV-rating like 40+ and the only stuff anywhere that can survive a three-set sweat. No one knows what jr. player at what academy found this out about Pledge years back or how: rather bizarre discovery-circumstances are envisioned. The smell of sweat-wet Pledge out on the court makes some of the more delicately constituted kids sick though. Others feel sunscreen of any kind to be unconscionably pussified like white visors or on-court sunglasses. So most of the E.T.A. upperclassmen have these vivid shoeand-shirt tans that give them the classic look of bodies hastily assembled from different bodies' parts especially when you throw in the heavily muscled legs and usually shallow chests and the two arms of different sizes. 'Tard tard tard' Stice says. Group empathy is expressed via sighs further slumping small spastic gestures of exhaustion the soft clanks of skulls' backs against the lockers' thin steel. 'My bones are ringing the way sometimes people say their ears are ringing I'm so tired.’ 'I'm waiting til the last possible second to even breathe. I'm not expanding the cage till driven by necessity of air.’ 'So tired it's out of tired's word-range' Pemulis says. 'Tired just doesn't do it.’ 'Exhausted shot depleted' says Jim Struck grinding at his closed eye with the heel of his hand. 'Cashed. Totalled.’ 'Look.' Pemulis pointing at Struck. 'It's trying to think.’ 'A moving thing to see.’ 'Beat. Worn the heck out.’ 'Worn the fuck-all out is more like.’ 'Wrung dry. Whacked. Tuckered out. More dead than alive.’ 'None even come close the words.’ 'Word-inflation' Stice says rubbing at his crewcut so his forehead wrinkles and clears. 'Bigger and better. Good greater greatest totally great. Hyperbolic and hyperbolicker. Like grade-inflation.’ 'Should be so lucky' says Struck who's been on academic probation since fifteen. Stice is from a part of southwest Kansas that might as well be Oklahoma. He makes the companies that give him clothes and gear give him all black clothes and gear and his E.T.A. cognomen is 'The Darkness.’ Hal raises his eyebrows at Stice and smiles. 'Hyperbolicker?’ 'My daddy as a boy he'd have said "tuckered out'"ll do just fine.’ 'Whereas here we are sitting here needing whole new words and terms.’ 'Phrases and clauses and models and structures' Troeltsch says referring again to a prescriptive exam everyone but Hal wishes now to forget. 'We need an inflation-generative grammar.’ Keith Freer makes a motion as if taking his unit out of his towel and holding it out at Troeltsch: 'Generate this.’ 'Need a whole new syntax for fatigue on days like this' Struck says. 'E.T.A.'s best minds on the problem. Whole thesauruses digested analyzed.' Makes a sarcastic motion. 'Hal?’ One semion that still works fine is holding your fist up and cranking at it with the other hand so the finger you're giving somebody goes up like a drawbridge. Though of course Hal's mocking himself at the same time. Everybody agrees it speaks volumes. Idris Arslanian's shoes and incisors appear briefly in the doorway's steam then withdraw. Everyone's reflection is sort of cubist in the walls' shiny tiling. The name handed down paternally from an Umbrian five generations past and now much diluted by N.E. Yankee a great-grandmother with Pima-tribe Indian S.W. blood and Canadian cross-breeding Hal is the only extant Incandenza who looks in any way ethnic. His late father had been as a young man darkly tall high flat Pima-tribe cheekbones and very black hair Brylcreemed back so tight there'd been a kind of enforced widow's peak. Himself had looked ethnic but he isn't extant. Hal is sleek sort of radiantly dark almost otterish only slightly tall eyes blue but darkly so and unburnable even w/o sunscreen his untanned feet the color of weak tea his nose ever unpeeling but slightly shiny. His sleekness isn't oily so much as moist milky; Hal worries secretly that he looks half-feminine. His parents' pregnancies must have been all-out chro-mosomatic war: Hal's eldest brother Orin had got the Moms's Anglo-Nordo-Canadian phenotype the deep-socketed and lighter-blue eyes the faultless posture and incredible flexibility (Orin was the only male anybody at E.T.A.'d ever heard of who could do a fully splayed cheerleader-type split) the rounder and more protrusive zygomatics. Hal's next-oldest brother Mario doesn't seem to resemble much of anyone they know. On most of the nontravel days that he doesn't Big Buddy with his charges Hal will wait till most everybody's busy in the sauna and shower and stow his sticks in his locker and stroll casually down the cement steps into E.T.A.'s system of tunnels and chambers. He has some way he can casually drift off and have quite a while go by before anyone even notices his absence. He'll often stroll casually back into the locker room just as people are slumped on the floor in towels discussing fatigue carrying his gear bag and substantially altered in mood and go in when most of the littler kids are in there peeling Pledge-husks off their limbs and taking their turn showering and shower using one of the kids' shampoo out of a bottle shaped like a cartoon character then hike the head back and apply Visine in a Schacht-free stall gargle and brush and floss and dress usually not even needing to comb his hair. He carries Visine AC mint-flavored floss and a traveller's toothbrush in a pocket of his Dunlop gear bag. Ted Schacht big into oral hygiene regards Hal's bag's floss and brush as an example to them all. 'So tired it's like I'm almost high.’ 'But not pleasantly high' Troeltsch says. 'It'd be a pleasanter tiredness-high if I didn't have to wait till fucking 1900 to start all this studyin'' Stice says. 'You'd think Schtitt could at least not turn up the juice the week before midterms.’ 'You'd think that the coaches and the teachers could try and get together on their scheduling.’ 'It'd be like a pleasant fatigue if I could just go up after dinner and hunker on down with the mind in neutral and watch something uncomplex.’ 'Not have to worry about prescriptive forms or acutance.’ 'Kick back.’ 'Watch something with chase scenes and lots of stuff blowing up all over the place.’ 'Relax do bongs kick back look at lingerie catalogues eat granola with a great big wooden spoon' Struck says wistfully. 'Get laid.’ 'Just get one night off to like R and R.’ 'Slip on the old environmental suit and listen to some atonal jazz.’ 'Have sex. Get laid.’ 'Bump uglies. Do the nasty. Haul ashes.’ 'Find me one of them Northeast Oklahoma drive-in burger-stand waitresses with the great big huge titties.’ 'Those enormous pink-white French-painting tits that sort of like tumble out.’ 'One of those wooden spoons so big you can barely get your mouth around it.’ 'Just one night to relax and indulge.’ Pemulis belts out two quick verses of Johnny Mathis's 'Chances Are' left over from the shower then subsides to examine something on his left thigh. Shaw has a spit-bubble going growing to such exceptional size for just spit that half the room watches until it finally goes at the same moment Pemulis breaks off. Evan Ingersoll says 'We get off Saturday for Interdependence Day Eve though the board said.’ Several upperclass heads are cocked up at Ingersoll. Pemulis makes a bulge in his cheek with his tongue and moves it around. 'Flubbaflubba': Stice makes his jowls fly around. 'We get off classes is all. Drills and challenges go merrily on deLint says' Freer points out. 'But no drills Sunday before the Gala.’ 'But still matches.’ Every jr. player presently in this room is ranked in the top 64 continen-tally except Pemulis Yardley and Blott. There'd be clear evidence that T. Schacht's still in one of the toilet stalls off the showers even if Hal couldn't see the tip of one of Schacht's enormous purple shower thongs under the door of the stall right by where the shower-area entryway cuts into his line of sight. Something humble placid even about inert feet under stall doors. The defecatory posture is an accepting posture it occurs to him. Head down elbows on knees the fingers laced together between the knees. Some hunched timeless millennial type of waiting almost religious. Luther's shoes on the floor beneath the chamber pot placid possibly made of wood Luther's 16thcentury shoes awaiting epiphany. The mute quiescent suffering of generations of salesmen in the stalls of train-station Johns heads down fingers laced shined shoes inert awaiting the acid gush. Women's slippers centurions' dusty sandals dock-workers' hobnailed boots Popes' slippers. All waiting pointing straight ahead slightly tapping. Huge shaggy-browed men in skins hunched just past the firelight's circle with wadded leaves in one hand waiting. Schacht suffered from Crohn's Disease4343 a bequest from his ulcerative-colitic dad and had to take carminative medication with every meal and took a lot of guff about his digestive troubles and had developed of all things arthritic gout too somehow because of the Crohn's Disease which had settled in his right knee and caused him terrible pain on the court. Freer's and Tall Paul Shaw's racquets fall off the bench with a clatter and Beak and Blott move fast to pick them up and stack them back on the bench Beak one-handed because the other hand is keeping his towel fastened. 'Because so that was let's see' Struck says. Pemulis loves to sing around tile. Struck's hitting his palm with a finger for either emphasis or ordinal counting. 'Close to let's call it an hour run for the Asquads an hour-fifteen drills two matches back to back.’ 'I only played one' Troeltsch injects. 'Had a measurable fever in the a.m. deLint said to throttle down today.’ 'Folks that went three sets only played one match Spodek and Kent for an instance' Stice says. 'Funny how Troeltsch how his health always seems to rally when A.M. drills get out' Freer says. '— like conservatively two hours for the matches. Conservatively. Then half an hour on the machines under fucking Loach's beady browns sitting there with the clipboard. That's let's call it five hours of vigorous nonstop straight-out motion.’ 'Sustained and strenuous exertion.’ 'Schtitt's determinated this year we ain't singing no silly songs at Port Washington.’ John Wayne hasn't said one word this whole time. The contents of his locker are neat and organized. He always buttons his shirt all the way up to the top button as if he were going to put on a tie which he doesn't even own. IngersolPs also getting dressed out of his underclassman's small square locker. Stice says 'Except they seem to forget we're still in our puberty.’ Ingersoll is a kid seemingly wholly devoid of eyebrows as far as Hal can see. 'Speak for yourself Darkness.’ 'I'm saying how stressing the pubertyizing skeleton like this it's real short-sighted.' Stice's voice rises.' 'm I supposed to do when I'm twenty and in the Show playing nonstop and I'm skeletally stressed and injury-proned?’ 'Dark's right.’ A curled bit of cloudy old Pledge-husk and a green thread from a strip of GauzeTex wrap are complexly entwined in the blue fibers of the carpet near Hal's left ankle which ankle is faintly swollen and has a blue tinge. He keeps flexing the ankle whenever it occurs to him to. Struck and Troeltsch spar briefly with open hands feinting and bobbing their heads both still seated on the floor. Hal Stice Troeltsch Struck Rader and Beak are all rhythmically squeezing tennis balls with their racquet-hands as per Academy mandate. Struck's shoulders and neck have furious purple inflammations; Hal had also noticed a boil on the inside of Schacht's thigh when Ted'd sat down. Hal's face's reflection just fits inside one of the wall-tiles opposite and then if he moves his head slowly the face distends and comes back together with an optical twang in the next tile. That post-shower community feeling is dissipating. Even Evan Ingersoll looks quickly at his watch and clears his throat. Wayne and Shaw have dressed and left; Freer a major Pledge-devotee is at his hair in the mirror Pemulis also rising now to get away from Freer's feet and legs. Freer's eyes have a protrusive wideness to them that the Axhandle says makes Freer always look like he's getting shocked or throttled. And time in the p.m. locker room seems of limitless depth; they've all been just here before just like this and will be again tomorrow. The light saddening outside a grief felt in the bones a sharpness to the edge of the lengthening shadows. T'm thinking it's Tavis' Freer says to them all in the mirror. 'Where there's excess work and suffering can fucking Tavis be far behind.’ 'No it's Schtitt' Hal says. 'Schtitt was short a few wickets out of the old croquet set long before he got hold of us men' Pemulis says. 'Peemster and Hal.’ 'Halation and Pemurama.’ Freer purses his little lips and expels air like he's blowing out a match blowing some tiny grooming-remnant off the big mirror's glass. 'Schtitt just does what he's told like a good Nazi.’ 'What the hail is that supposed to mean?' asks a Stice who's well known for asking How High Sir when Schtitt says Jump now feeling at the carpet around him for something to throw at Freer. Ingersoll tosses Stice a woppsed-up towel trying to be helpful but Slice's eyes are on Freer's in the glass and the towel hits him on the head and sits there on his head. The room's emotions seem to be inverting themselves every couple seconds. There's half-cruel laughter at Stice as Hal struggles to his feet rising in careful stages putting most of his weight on the good ankle. Hal's towel falls off as he does his combination. Struck says something that's lost in the roar of a high-pressure toilet. The feminized American stood at a slight angle to Marathe upon the outcropping. He stared out at the dusk-shadow they were now inside and as well the increasingly complicated twinkle of the U.S.A. city Tucson seeming slackly transfixed Steeply in the way vistas too large for the eye to contain transfix persons in a kind of torpid spectation. Marathe seemed on the edge of sleep. Even the voice of Steeply had a different timbre inside the shadow. 'They say it's a great and maybe even timeless love Rod Tine's for your Luria person.’ Marathe grunted shifting slightly in the chair. Steeply said 'The sort that gets sung about the kind people die for and then get immortalized in song. You got your ballads your operas. Tristan and Isolde. Lancelot and what's-her-name. Agamemnon and Helen Dante and Beatrice.’ Marathe's drowsy smile continued upward to become a wince. 'Narcissus and Echo. Kierkegaard and Regina. Kafka and that poor girl afraid to go to the postbox for the mail.’ 'Interesting choice of example here the mailbox.' Steeply pretended to chuckle. Marathe came alert. Take off your wig and be shitting inside it Hugh Steeply B.S.S. And the ignorance of you appalls me. Agamemnon had no relation with this queen. Menelaus was husband him of Sparta. And you mean Paris. Helen and Paris. He of Troy.’ Steeply seemed amused in the idiotic way: 'Paris and Helen the face that launched vessels. The horse: the gift which was not a gift. The anonymous gift brought to the door. The sack of Troy from inside.’ Marathe rose slightly on his stumps in the chair showing some emotions at this Steeply. 'I am seated here appalled at the naïveté of history of your nation. Paris and Helen were the excuse of the war. All the Greek states in addition to the Sparta of Menelaus attacked Troy because Troy controlled the Dardanelles and charged the ruinous tolls for passage through which the Greeks who would like very dearly the easy sea passage for trade with the Oriental East resented with fury. It was for commerce this war. The one-quotes "love" one-does-not-quote of Paris for Helen merely was the excuse.’ Steeply genius of interviewing sometimes affected more than usual idiocy with Marathe which he knew baited Marathe. 'Everything reduces itself to politics for you guys. Wasn't that whole war just a song? Did that war even really take place that anybody knows of?’ 'The point is that what launches vessels of war is the state and community and its interests' Marathe said without heat tiredly. 'You only wish to enjoy to pretend for yourself that the love of one woman could do this launch so many vessels of alliance.’ Steeply was stroking the perimeters of the mesquite-scratch which made his shrug appear awkward. 'I don't think I'd be so sure. Those around Rod the God say the man would die twice for her. Say he wouldn't have to even think about it. Not just that he'd let the whole of O.N.A.N. come down if it came to that. But'd die.’ Marathe sniffed. 'Twice.’ 'Without even having to pause and think' Steeply said stroking at his lip's electrolysistic rash in a ruminative fashion. 'It's the reason most of us think he's still there why he's still got President Gentle's ear. Divided loyalties are one thing. But if he does it for love — well then you've got a kind of tragic element that transcends the political wouldn't you say?' Steeply smiled broadly down at Marathe. Marathe's own betrayal of A.F.R.: for medical care for the conditions of his wife; for (Steeply might imagine to think) love of a person a woman. 'Tragic saying as if Rodney Tine of Nonspecificity were not responsible for choosing it as the insane are not responsible' said Marathe quietly. Steeply now was smiling even more broadly. 'It has a kind of tragic quality timeless musical that how could Gentle resist?’ Marathe's tone now became derisive despite his legendary sangfroid in matters of technical interviews: 'These sentiments from a person who allows them to place him in the field as an enormous girl with tits at the cock-eyed angle now discoursing on tragic love.’ Steeply impassive and slackly ruminative picked at the lipstick of the corner of his mouth with a littlest finger removing some grain of grit gazing out from their shelf of stone. 'But sure. The fanatically patriotic Wheelchair Assassins of southern Quebec scorn this type of interpersonal sentiment between people.' Looking now down at Marathe. 'No? Even though it's just this that has brought you Tine yours for Luria to command should it ever come to that?’ Marathe had settled back on his bottom in the chair. 'Your U.S.A. word for fanatic "fanatic" do they teach you it comes from the Latin for "temple"? It is meaning literally "worshipper at the temple." 'Oh Jesus now here we go again' Steeply said. 'As if you will give the permission does this love you speak of M. Tine's grand love. It means only the attachment. Tine is attached fanatically. Our attachments are our temple what we worship no? What we give ourselves to what we invest with faith.’ Steeply made motions of weary familiarity. 'Herrrrrre we go.’ Marathe ignored this. 'Are we not all of us fanatics? I say only what you of the U.S.A. only pretend you do not know. Attachments are of great seriousness. Choose your attachments carefully. Choose your temple of fanaticism with great care. What you wish to sing of as tragic love is an attachment not carefully chosen. Die for one person? This is a craziness. Persons change leave die become ill. They leave lie go mad have sickness betray you die. Your nation outlives you. A cause outlives you.’ 'How are your wife and kids doing up there by the way?’ 'You U.S.A.'s do not seem to believe you may each choose what to die for. Love of a woman the sexual it bends back in on the self makes you narrow maybe crazy. Choose with care. Love of your nation your country and people it enlarges the heart. Something bigger than the self.’ Steeply laid a hand between his misdirected breasts: 'Ohh . . . Can-ada.. ..’ Marathe leaned again forward on his stumps. 'Make amusement all you wish. But choose with care. You are what you love. No? You are completely and only what you would die for without as you say the thinking twice. You M. Hugh Steeply: you would die without thinking for what?’ The A.F.R.'s extensive file on Steeply included mention of his recent divorce. Marathe already had informed Steeply of the existence of this file. He wondered how badly Steeply doubted what he reported Marathe or whether he assumed its truth simply. Though the persona of him changed Steeply's car for all field assignments was this green sedan subsidized by a painful ad for aspirin upon its side — the file knew this stupidity — Marathe was sure the sedan with its aspirin advertisement was somewhere below them unseen. The fanatically beloved car of M. Hugh Steeply. Steeply was watching or gazing at the darkness of the desert floor. He did not respond. His expression of boredom could be real or tactical either of these. Marathe said 'This is it not the choice of the most supreme importance? Who teaches your U.S.A. children how to choose their temple? What to love enough not to think two times?’ 'This from a man who —’ Marathe was willing that his voice not rise. 'For this choice determines all else. No? All other of our you say free choices follow from this: what is our temple. What is the temple thus for U.S.A.'s? What is it when you fear that you must protect them from themselves if wicked Québecers conspire to bring the Entertainment into their warm homes?’ Steeply's face had assumed the openly twisted sneering expression which he knew well Québecers found repellent on Americans. 'But you assume it's always choice conscious decision. This isn't just a little naïve Rémy? You sit down with your little accountant's ledger and soberly decide what to love? Always?’ 'The alternatives are —’ 'What if sometimes there is no choice about what to love? What if the temple comes to Mohammed? What if you just love? without deciding? You just do: you see her and in that instant are lost to sober account-keeping and cannot choose but to love?’ Marathe's sniff held disdain. 'Then in such a case your temple is self and sentiment. Then in such an instance you are a fanatic of desire a slave to your individual subjective narrow self's sentiments; a citizen of nothing. You become a citizen of nothing. You are by yourself and alone kneeling to yourself.’ A silence ensued this. Marathe shifted in his chair. 'In a case such as this you become the slave who believes he is free. The most pathetic of bondage. Not tragic. No songs. You believe you would die twice for another but in truth would die only for your alone self its sentiment.’ Another silence ensued. Steeply who had made his early career with Unspecified Services conducting technical interviews4444 used silent pauses as integral parts of his techniques of interface. Here it defused Marathe. Marathe felt the ironies of his position. One strap of Steeply's prostheses' brassiere had slipped into view below his shoulder where it cut deeply into his flesh of the upper arm. The air smelled faintly of creosote but much less strongly smelling than the ties of train tracks which Marathe had smelled at close range. Steeply's back was broad and soft. Marathe eventually said: 'You in such a case have nothing. You stand on nothing. Nothing of ground or rock beneath your feet. You fall; you blow here and there. How does one say: "tragically unvoluntarily lost." Another silence ensued. Steeply farted mildly. Marathe shrugged. The B.S.S. Field Operative Steeply may not have been truly sneering. The city Tucson's lume appeared a bleached and ghostly white in the unhumid air. Crepuscular animals rustled and perhaps scuttled. Dense and unbeautiful spider webs of the poisonous U.S.A. species of spider Black Widow were beneath the shelf and the incline's other outcroppíngs. And when the wind hit certain angles in the mountainside it moaned. Marathe thought of his victory over the train that had taken his legs.4545 He attempted in English to sing: ' "Ob Say Land of the Free." ‘ And they both could feel this queer dry night-desert chill descend with the moon's gibbous rise — a powdery wind down below making dust to shift and cactus needles whistle the sky's stars adjusting to the color of low flame — but were themselves not yet chilled even Steeply's sleeveless dress: he and Marathe stood and sat in the form-fitting astral spacesuit of warmth their own radiant heat produced. This is what happens in dry night climes Marathe was learning. His dying wife had never once left southwestern Quebec. Les Assassins des Fauteuils Roulents' remote embryonic dissemina-tory Ops base down here in Southwest U.S.A. seemed to him like the surface of the moon: four corrugated Quonsets and kiln-baked earth and air that swam and shimmered like the area behind jet engines. Empty and dirty-windowed rooms doorknobs hot to touch and hell-stench inside the empty rooms. Steeply was continuing saying nothing while he tamped down another of his long Belgian cigarettes. Marathe continued to hum the U.S.A. song all over the map in terms of key. 3 NOVEMBER Y.D.A.U. 'Because none of them really meant any of it' Hal tells Kent Blott. 'The end-of-the-day hatred of all the work is just part of the work. You think Schtitt and deLint don't know we're going to sit in there together after showers and bitch? It's all planned out. The bitchers and moaners in there are just doing what's expected.’ 'But I look at these guys that've been here six seven years eight years still suffering hurt beat up so tired just like I feel tired and suffer I feel this what dread this dread I see seven or eight years of unhappiness every day and day after day of tiredness and stress and suffering stretching ahead and for what for a chance at a like a pro career that I'm starting to get this dready feeling a career in the Show means even more suffering if I'm skele-tally stressed from all the grueling here by the time I get there.’ Blott's on his back on the shag carpet — all five of them are — stretched out splay-limbed with their heads up supported on double-width velourish throw-pillows on the floor of V.R.6 one of the three little Viewing Rooms on the second floor of the Comm.-Ad. Bldg. two flights up from the locker rooms and three from the main tunnel's mouth. The room's new cartridge-viewer is huge and almost painfully high-definition; it hangs flat on the north wall like a large painting; it runs off a refrigerated chip; the room's got no TP or phone-console; it's very specialized just a player and viewer and tapes; the cartridge-player sits on the second shelf of a small bookcase beneath the viewer; the other shelves and several other cases are full of match-cartridges motivational and visualization cartridges — InterLace Tat-suoka Yushityu SyberVision. The 300-track wire from the cartridgeplayer up to the lower-right corner of the wall-hung viewer is so thin it looks like a crack in the wall's white paint. Viewing Rooms are windowless and the air from the vent is stale. Though when the viewer's on it looks like the room has a window. Hal's put on an undemanding visualization-type cartridge as he usually does for a Big Buddy group-interface when they're all tired. He's killed the volume so you can't hear the reinforcing mantra but the picture is bright and bell-clear. It's like the picture almost leaps out at you. A graying and somewhat ravaged-looking Stan Smith in anachronistic white is at a court's baseline hitting textbook forehands over and over again the same stroke his back sort of osteoporotically hunched but his form immaculate his footwork textbook and effortless — the frictionless pivot and back-set of weight the anachronistic Wilson wood stick back and pointing straight to the fence behind him the fluid transfer of weight to the front foot as the ball comes in the contact at waistlevel and just out front the front leg's muscles bunching up as the back leg's settle eyes glued to the yellow ball in the center of his strings' stencilled W — E.T.A. kids are conditioned to watch not just the ball but the ball's rotating seams to read the spin coming in — the front knee dipping slightly down under bulging quads as the weight flows more forward the back foot up almost en-pointe on the gleaming sneaker's unscuffed toe the no-nonsense flourishless follow-through so the stick ends up just in front of his gaunt face — Smith's cheeks have hollowed as he's aged his face has collapsed at the sides his eyes seem to bulge from the cheekbones that protrude as he inhales after impact he looks desiccated aged in hot light performing the same motions over and over for decades his other hand floating up gently to grasp the stick's throat out in front of the face so he's flowed back into the Ready Stance all over again. No wasted motion egoless strokes no flourishes or tics or excesses of wrist. Over and over each forehand melting into the next a loop it's hypnotizing it's supposed to be. The soundtrack says 'Don't Think Just See Don't Know Just Flow' over and over if you turn it up. You're supposed to pretend it's you on the bell-clear screen with the fluid and egoless strokes. You're supposed to disappear into the loop and then carry that disappearance out with you to play. The kids're lying there limp and splayed supine jaws slack eyes wide and dim a relaxed exhausted warmth — the flooring beneath the shag is gently heated. Peter Beak is asleep with his eyes open a queer talent E.T.A. seems to instill in the younger ones. Orin had been able to sleep with his eyes open at the dinner table too at home. Hal's fingers long and light brown and still slightly sticky from tincture of benzoin4646 are laced behind his upraised head on the pillow cupping his own skull watching Stan Smith eyes heavy too. 'You feel as though you'll be going through the exact same sort of suffering at seventeen you suffer now here Kent?’ Kent Blott has colored shoelaces on his sneakers with 'Mr.-Bouncety-Bounce-Program'-brand bow-biters which Hal finds extraordinarily artless and young. Peter Beak snores softly a small spit-bubble protruding and receding. 'But Blott surely you've considered this: Why are they all still here then if it's so awful every day?’ 'Not every day' Blott says. 'But pretty often it's awful.’ 'They're here because they want the Show when they get out' Ingersoll sniffs and says. The Show meaning the A.T.P. Tour travel and cash prizes and endorsements and appearance fees match-highlights in video mags action photos in glossy print-mags. 'But they know and we know one very top junior in twenty even gets all the way to the Show. Much less survives there long. The rest slog around on the satellite tours or regional tours or get soft as club pros. Or become lawyers or academics like everyone else' Hal says softly. 'Then they stay and suffer to get a scholarship. A college ride. A white cardigan with a letter. Girl coeds keen on lettermen.’ 'Kent except for Wayne and Pemulis not one guy in there needs any kind of scholarship. Pemulis'll get a full ride anywhere he wants just on test-scores. Slice's aunts'll send him anywhere even if he doesn't want to play. And Wayne's headed for the Show he'll never do more than a year in the O.N.A.N.C.A.A.'s.' Blott's father a cutting-edge E.N.T. oncologist flew all over the world removing tumors from wealthy mucous membranes; Blott has a trust fund. 'None of that's the point and you guys know it.’ 'They love the game you're going to say.’ Stan Smith has switched to backhands. 'They sure must love something Ingersoll but how about for a second I say that's not Kent's point either. Kent's point's the misery in that room just now. K.B. I've taken part in essentially that same bitter bitchy kind of session hundreds of times with those same guys after bad P.M.s. In the showers in the sauna at dinner.’ 'Very much bitching also in the lavatories' Arslanian says. Hal unsticks his hair from his fingers. Arslanian always has a queer faint hot-doggish smell about him. 'The point is it's ritualistic. The bitching and moaning. Even assuming they feel the way they say when they get together the point is notice we were all sitting there all feeling the same way together.’ 'The point is togetherness?’ 'Shouldn't there be violas for this part Hal if this is the point?’ 'Ingersoll I —’ Beak's cold-weather adenoids wake him periodically and he gurgles and his eyes roll up briefly before they level out and he settles back seeming to stare. Hal creatively visualizes that Smith's velvety backhand is him slo-mo slapping Evan Ingersoll into the opposite wall. Ingersoll's parents founded the Rhode Island version of the service where you order groceries by TP and teenagers in fleets of station wagons bring them out to you instead of supermarkets. 'What the point is is that we'd all just spent three hours playing challenges against each other in scrotum-tightening cold assailing each other trying to take away each other's spots on the squads. Trying to defend them against each other's assaults. The system's got inequality as an axiom. We know where we stand entirely in relation to one another. John Wayne's over me and I'm over Struck and Shaw who two years back were both over me but under Troeltsch and Schacht and now are over Troeltsch who as of today is over Freer who's substantially over Schacht who can't beat anyone in the room except Pemulis since his knee and Crohn's Disease got so much worse and is barely hanging on in terms of ranking and is showing incredible balls just hanging on. Freer beat me 4 and 2 in the quarters of the U.S. Clays two summers ago and now he's on the B-squad and five slots below me six slots if Troeltsch can still beat him when they play again after that illness-default.’ 'I am over Blott. I am over Ingersoll' Idris Arslanian nods. 'Well Blott's just ten Idris. And you're under Chu who's on an odd year and is under Possalthwaite. And Blott's under Beak and Ingersoll simply by virtue of age-division.’ 'I know just where I stand at all times' muses Ingersoll. SyberVision edits its visualization sequences with a melt-filter so Stan Smith's follow-through loops seamlessly into his backswing for the exact same next stroke; the transitions are gauzy and dreamlike. Hal struggles to hike himself up onto his elbows: 'We're all on each other's food chain. All of us. It's an individual sport. Welcome to the meaning of individual. We're each deeply alone here. It's what we all have in common this aloneness.’ 'E Unibus Pluram'' Ingersoll muses. Hal looks from face to face. Ingersoll's face is completely devoid of eyebrows and is round and dustily freckled not unlike a Mrs. Clarke pancake. 'So how can we also be together? How can we be friends? How can Ingersoll root for Arslanian in Idris's singles at the Port Washington thing when if Idris loses Ingersoll gets to challenge for his spot again?’ 'I do not require his root for I am ready.' Arslanian bares canines. 'Well that's the whole point. How can we be friends? Even if we all live and eat and shower and play together how can we keep from being 136 deeply alone people all jammed together?’ 'You're talking about community. This is a community-spiel.’ 'I think alienation' Arslanian says rolling the profile over to signify he's talking to Ingersoll. 'Existential individuality frequently referred to in the West. Solipsism.' His upper lip goes up and down over his teeth. Hal says 'In a nutshell what we're talking about here is loneliness.’ Blott looks about ready to cry. Beak's palsied eyes and little limb-spasms signify a troubling dream. Blott rubs his nose furiously with the heel of his hand. 'I miss my dog' Ingersoll concedes. 'Ah.' Hal rolls onto one elbow to hike a finger into the air. 'Ah. But then so notice the instant group-cohesion that formed itself around all the pissing and moaning down there why don't you. Blott. You Kent. This was your question. The what looks like sadism the skeletal stress the fatigue. The suffering unites us. They want to let us sit around and bitch. Together. After a bad P.M. set we all however briefly get to feel we have a common enemy. This is their gift to us. Their medicine. Nothing brings you together like a common enemy.’ 'Mr. deLint.’ 'Dr. Tavis. Schtitt.’ 'DeLint. Watson. Nwangi. Thode. All Schtitt's henchmen and henchwo-men.’ 'I hate them!' Blott cries out. 'And you've been here this long and you still think this hatred's an accident?’ 'Purchase a clue Kent Blott!' Arslanian says. 'The large and economy-size clue Blott' Ingersoll chimes. Beak sits up and says 'God no not with pliers!' and collapses back again again with the spit-bubble. Hal is pretending incredulity. 'You guys haven't noticed yet the way Schtitt's whole staff gets progressively more foultempered and sadistic as an important competitive week comes up?’ Ingersoll up on one elbow at Blott. 'The Port Washington meet. I.D. Day. The Tucson WhataBurger the week after. They want us in absolute top shape Blott.’ Hal lies back and lets Smith's ballet de se loosen his facial muscles again staring. 'Shit Ingersoll we're all in top shape already. That's not it. That's the least of it. We're off the charts shape-wise.’ Ingersoll: 'The average North American kid can't even do one pull-up according to Nwangi.’ Arslanian points down at his own chest. 'Twenty-eight pull-ups.’ 'The point' Hal says softly 'is that it's not about the physical anymore men. The physical stuff's just pro forma. It's the heads they're working on here boys. Day and year in and out. A whole program. It'll help your attitude to look for evidence of design. They always give us something to hate really hate together as big stuff looms. The dreaded May drills during finals before the summer tour. The post-Christmas crackdown before Australia. The November freezathon the snot-fest the delay in upping the Lung and getting us under cover. A common enemy. / may despise K. B. Freer or' (can't quite resist) 'Evan Ingersoll or Jennie Bash. But we despise Schtitt's men the double matches on top of runs the insensitivity to exams the repetition the stress. The loneliness. But we get together and bitch all of a sudden we're giving something group expression. A community voice. Community Evan. Oh they're cunning. They give themselves up to our dislike calculate our breaking points and aim for just over them then send us into the locker room with an unstructured forty-five before Big Buddy sessions. Accident? Random happenstance? You guys ever see evidence of the tiniest lack of coolly calculated structure around here?’ 'The structure's what I hate the most of all' Ingersoll says. 'They know what's going on' Blott says bouncing a little on his tailbone. 'They want us to get together and complain.’ 'Oh they're cunning' Ingersoll says. Hal curls himself a bit on one elbow to put in a small plug of Kodíak. He can't tell whether Ingersoll's being insolent. He lies there very slack visualizing Smith pounding overheads down onto Ingersoll's skull. Hal some weeks back had acquiesced to Lyle's diagnosis that Hal finds Ingersoll — this smart soft caustic kid with a big soft eyebrowless face and unwrinkled thumbjoints with the runty cuddled look of a Mama's boy from way back a quick intelligence he squanders on an insatiable need to advance some impression of himself — that the kid so repels Hal because Hal sees in the kid certain parts of himself he can't or won't accept. None of this ever occurs to Hal when Ingersoll's in the room. He wishes him ill. Blott and Arslanian are looking at him. 'Are you OK?’ 'He is tired' Arslanian says. Ingersoll drums idly on his own ribcage. Hal usually gets secretly high so regularly these days this year that if by dinnertime he hasn't gotten high yet that day his mouth begins to fill with spit — some rebound effect from B. Hope's desiccating action — and his eyes start to water as if he's just yawned. The smokeless tobacco started almost as an excuse to spit sometimes. Hal's struck by the fact that he really for the most part believes what he's said about loneliness and the structured need for a we here; and this together with the Ingersoll-repulsion and spit-flood makes him uncomfortable again brooding uncomfortably for a moment on why he gets off on the secrecy of getting high in secret more than on the getting high itself possibly. He always gets the feeling there's some clue to it on the tip of his tongue some mute and inaccessible part of the cortex and then he always feels vaguely sick scanning for it. The other thing that happens if he doesn't do one-hitters sometime before dinner is he feels slightly sick to his stomach and it's hard to eat enough at dinner and then later when he does go off and get off he gets ravenous and goes out to Father & Son Market for candy or else floods his eyes with Murine and heads down to the Headmaster's House for another late dinner with C.T. and the Moms and eats like such a feral animal that the Moms says it does something instinctively maternal in her heart good to see him pack it away but then he wakes before dawn with awful indigestion. 'So the suffering gets less lonely' Blott prompts him. Two curves down the hall in V.R.5 where the viewer's on the south wall and doesn't get turned on the Canadian John Wayne's got LaMont Chu and 'Sleepy T.P.' Peterson and Kieran McKenna and Brian van Vleck. 'He's talking about developing the concept of tennis mastery' Chu tells the other three. They're on the floor Indian-style Wayne standing with his back against the door rotating his head to stretch the neck. 'His point is that progress towards genuine Show-caliber mastery is slow frustrating. Humbling. A question of less talent than temperament.’ 'Is this right Mr. Wayne?’ Chu says '... that because you proceed toward mastery through a series of plateaus so there's like radical improvement up to a certain plateau and then what looks like a stall on the plateau with the only way to get off one of the plateaus and climb up to the next one up ahead is with a whole lot of frustrating mindless repetitive practice and patience and hanging in there.’ 'Plateaux' Wayne says looking at the ceiling and pushing the back of his head isometrically against the door. 'With an X. Plateaux.’ The inactive viewer's screen is the color of way out over the Atlantic looking straight down on a cold day. Chu's cross-legged posture is textbook. 'What John's saying is the types who don't hang in there and slog on the patient road toward mastery are basically three. Types. You've got what he calls your Despairing type who's fine as long as he's in the quick-improvement stage before a plateau but then he hits a plateau and sees himself seem to stall not getting better as fast or even seeming to get a little worse and this type gives in to frustration and despair because he hasn't got the humbleness and patience to hang in there and slog and he can't stand the time he has to put in on plateaux and what happens?’ 'Geronímo!' the other kids yell not quite in sync. 'He bails right' Chu says. He refers to index cards. Wayne's head makes the door rattle slightly. Chu says 'Then you've got your Obsessive type J.W. says so eager to plateau-hop he doesn't even know the word patient much less bumble or slog when he gets stalled at a plateau he tries to like will and force himself off it by sheer force of work and drill and will and practice drilling and obsessively honing and working more and more as in frantically and he overdoes it and gets hurt and pretty soon he's all chronically messed up with injuries and he hobbles around on the court still obsessively overworking until finally he's hardly even able to walk or swing and his ranking plummets until finally one P.M. there's a little knock on his door and it's deLint here for a little chat about your progress here at E.T.A.’ 'Banzai! El Bailo! See ya!’ 'Then what John considers maybe the worst type because it can cunningly masquerade as patience and humble frustration. You've got the Complacent type who improves radically until he hits a plateau and is content with the radical improvement he's made to get to the plateau and doesn't mind staying at the plateau because it's comfortable and familiar and he doesn't worry about getting off it and pretty soon you find he's designed a whole game around compensating for the weaknesses and chinks in the armor the given plateau represents in his game still — his whole game is based on this plateau now. And little by little guys he used to beat start beating him locating the chinks of the plateau and his rank starts to slide but he'll say he doesn't care he says he's in it for the love of the game and he always smiles but there gets to be something sort of tight and hangdog about his smile and he always smiles and is real nice to everybody and real good to have around but he keeps staying where he is while other guys hop plateaux and he gets beat more and more but he's content. Until one day there's a quiet knock at the door.’ 'It's DeLint!’ 'A quiet chat!’ 'Geronzai!’ Van Vleck looks up at Wayne who's now turned away with his hands against the door frame shoving one leg back stretching the right calf. 'This is your advice Mr. Wayne sir? This isn't Chu palming himself off as you again?’ They all want to know how Wayne does it #2 continentally in 18's at just seventeen and very likely #1 after the WhataBurger and already getting calls from ProServ agents Tavis has Lateral Alice Moore screen. Wayne's the most sought-after Big Buddy at E.T.A. You have to apply for Wayne as Buddy by random drawing. LaMont Chu and T. P. Peterson are sending van Vleck optical daggers as Wayne turns around to stretch a hip-flexor and says he's said pretty much all he has to say. 'Todder I admire your savvy I admire a kid's certain worldly skepticism no matter how misplaced it is here. So even though it fucks me on the odds so there's now like practically no way I can come out square' M. Pemulis says in V.R.2 subdorm C sitting on the very edge of the divan with a few feet of beige shag between him and his four kids all cross-legged on cushions; he says Til reward your worldly skepticism this once by letting you try it with only two so like I've got just two cards here and I hold them up one in each hand....' He stops abruptly knocks his temple with the heel of a hand that holds a Jack. 'Whoa what am I thinking. We all gotta put in our fiveski here first.’ Otis P. Lord clears his throat: 'The ante.’ 'Or it's called the pot' says Todd Possalthwaite laying a five on the little pile. 'Jaysus I'm thinking sweet Jaysus what am I getting into with these kids that speak the lingo like veteran Jersey-shore croupiers. I got to be missing a widget or something 't the fuck though you know what I'm saying? So Todd man you choose just one of the cards we got the clubby Jack and the spade Queen here and you choose . . . and so down they go both of them facedown and I like swirl them around on the floor a little not shuffle but swirl so they're in plain view the whole time and you follllllowwwwwwww the card you chose around and around which like with three cards maybe I've got some chance you lose track but with two? With just two?’ Ted Schacht in V.R.3 at his giant plasticene oral demonstrator the huge dental mock-up white planks of teeth and obscene pink gums twine-size floss anchored around both wrists: 'The vital thing here gentlemen being not the force or how often you rotate to particulate-free floss but the motion see a soft sawing motion gently up and down both ancipitals of the enamel' — demonstrating down the side of a bicuspid big as the kids' heads the plasticene gum-stuff yielding with sick sucking sounds Schacht's five kids all either glazed-looking or glued to their watch's second-hand — 'and then here's the key here's the thing so few people understand: down below the ostensible gumline into the basal recessions at either side of the gingival mound that obtrudes between the teeth down below where your most pernicious particulates hide and breed.’ Troeltsch holds court in his Pemulis and Schacht's room in Subdorm C supinely upright against both of his and one of Schacht's pillows the vaporizer chugging one of his kids holding Kleenex at the ready. 'Boys what it is is I'll tell you it's repetition. First last always. It's hearing the same motivational stuff over and over till sheer repetitive weight makes it sink down into the gut. It's making the same pivots and lunges and strokes over and over and over again at you boys's age it's reps for their own sake putting results on the back burner why they never give anybody the boot for insufficient progress under fourteen it's repetitive movements and motions for their own sake over and over until the accretive weight of the reps sinks the movements themselves down under your like consciousness into the more nether regions through repetition they sink and soak into the hardware the C.P.S. The machine-language. The autonomical part that makes you breathe and sweat. It's no accident they say you Eat Sleep Breathe tennis here. These are autonomical. Accretive means accumulating through sheer mindless repeated motions. The machine-language of the muscles. Until you can do it without thinking about it play. At like fourteen give and take they figure here. Just do it. Forget about is there a point of course there's no point. The point of repetition is there is no point. Wait until it soaks into the hardware and then see the way this frees up your head. A whole shitload of head-space you don't need for the mechanics anymore after they've sunk in. Now the mechanics are wired in. Hardwired in. This frees the head in the remarkablest ways. Just wait. You start thinking a whole different way now playing. The court might as well be inside you. The ball stops being a ball. The ball starts being something that you just know ought to be in the air spinning. This is when they start getting on you about concentration. Right now of course you have to concentrate there's no choice it's not wired down into the language yet you have to think about it every time you do it. But wait till fourteen or fifteen. Then they see you as being at one of the like crucial plateaus. Fifteen tops. Then the concentration and character shit starts. Then they really come after you. This is the crucial plateau where character starts to matter. Focus self-consciousness the chattering head the cackling voices the choking-issue fear versus whatever isn't fear self-image doubts reluctances little tight-lipped cold-footed men inside your mind cackling about fear and doubt chinks in the mental armor. Now these start to matter. Thirteen at the earliest. Staff looks at a range of thirteen to fifteen. Also the age of manhood-rituals in various cultures. Think about it. Until then repetition. Until then you might as well be machines here is their view. You're just going through the motions. Think about the phrase: Going Through The Motions. Wiring them into the motherboard. You guys don't know how good you've got it right now.’ James Albrecht Lockley Struck Jr. of Orinda CA prefers one long Q&A-type interface with V.R.8's viewer playing ambient stuff against relaxation-vistas of surf shimmering ponds fields of nodding wheat. 'Time for about maybe two more me droogies.’ 'Say it's close and the guy starts kertwanging you. Balls are way in and he's calling them out. You can't believe the flagrancy of it.’ 'Implicit this is a no-linesman situation Traub you're saying.’ Creepily-blue-eyed Audern Tallat-Kelpsa chimes in: 'This is early rounds. The kind they give you only two balls. Honor systems. All of a sudden there he is kertwanging on you. It happens.’ 'I know it happens.’ Traub says 'Whether he's outright kertwanging or just head-fucking you. Do you start kertwanging back? Tit for tat? What do you do?’ 'Do we assume there's a crowd.’ 'Early round. Remote court. No witnesses. You're on your own out there. Do you kertwang back.’ 'You do not kertwang back. You play the calls not a word keep smiling. If you still win you'll have grown inside as a person.’ 'If you lose?’ 'If you lose you do something private and unpleasant to his water-jug right before his next round.’ A couple of the kids have notebooks and studious nods. Struck is a prized tactician very formal in B.B. group-sessions something scholarly and detached about him his charges often revere. 'We can discuss private water-jug unpleasantness on Friday' Struck says looking at his watch. A hand raised by the violently cross-eyed Carl Whale age thirteen. Acknowledgment from Struck. 'Say you have to fart.’ 'You're serious Mobes aren't you.’ 'Jim sir say you're playing out there and suddenly you have to fart. It feels like one of those real hot nasty pressurized ones.’ 'I get the picture.’ Now some empathic murmurs exchanged looks. Josh Gopnik is nodding very intensely. Struck stands very straight to the right of the viewer hands behind his back like an Oxford don. 'I mean the kind that's real urgent.' Whale looks briefly around him. 'But that it's not impossible it's actually a need to go to the bathroom instead masquerading as a fart.’ Now five heads are nodding pained urgent: clearly a vexing sub-14 issue. Struck examines a cuticle. 'Meaning defecate is what you mean then Mobes. Go to the bathroom.’ Gopnik looks up. 'Carl's saying the kind where you don't know what to do. What if you think you have to fart but it's really that you have to shit?’ 'As in it's a competitive situation it's not a situation where you can go bearing down and forcing and see what happens.’ 'So out of caution you don't' Gopnik says. '—fart' Philip Traub says. 'But then you've denied yourself an urgent fart and you're running around trying to compete with a terrible hot nasty uncomfortable fart riding around the court inside you.’ Two levels down Ortho Stice and his brood: the little libraryish circle of soft chairs and lamps in the warm foyer off the front door to subdorm C: 'And what he says he says it's about more than tennis mein kinder. Mein kinder well it sort of means my family. He eyeballs me right square in the eye and says it's about how to reach down into parts of yourself you didn't know were there and get down in there and live inside these parts. And the only way to get to them: sacrifice. Suffer. Deny. What are you willing to give. You'll hear him ask it if you're privileged to ever get an interface. The call could come at anytime: the man wants a mano-to-mano interface. You'll hear him say it over and over. What have you got to give. What are you willing to part with. I see you're looking a little pale there Wagen-knecht. Is this scary you bet your little pink personal asses it's scary. It's the big time. He'll tell you straight the fuck out. It's about discipline and sacrifice and honor to something way bigger than your personal ass. He'll mention America. He'll talk patriotism and don't think he won't. He'll talk about it's patriotic play that's the high road to the thing. He's not American but I tell you straight out right here he makes me proud to be American. Mein kinder. He'll say it's how to learn to be a good American during a time boys when America isn't good its own self.’ There's a long pause. The front door is newer than the wood around it. 'I'd chew fiberglass for that old man.’ The only reason the Buddies in V.R.8 can hear the little burst of applause from the foyer is because Struck won't hesitate to pause and consider silently as long as he has to. To the kids the pauses spell dignity and integrity and the still-water depth of a guy with nine years in at three different academies and who has to shave daily. He exhales a slow breath through rounded lips looking off up at the ceiling's guilloche border. 'Mobes if it's me: I let it ride.’ 'You let it out come what may?’ 'A la contraire. I let it ride around inside all day if I have to. I make an iron rule: nothing escapes my bottom during play. Not a toot or a whistle. If I play hunched over I play hunched over. I take the discomfort in the name of dignified caution and when it's especially bad I look up at sky between points and I say to the sky Thank You Sir may I have another. Thank You Sir may I have another.’ Gopnik and Tallat-Kelpsa are writing this down. Struck says 'That's if I want to hang for the long haul.’ 'One side of the gingival mound then up over the apex and down over the other side of the gingival mound using you should cultivate a certain amount of touch with the string.’ 'Now the big question of character is do we let a fluke of a probably one-in-a-hundred lapse in concentration make us throw up our faggy hands and go dragging characterlessly back to our dens to lick the whimpering wounds or do we narrow our eyes and put out the chin and say Pemulis we say we say Pemulis Double or Nothing when the odds remain so almost crazily stacked in our favor today.’ 'So they do it on purpose?' Beak is asking. 'Try to make us hate them?’ Limits and rituals. It's almost time for communal dinner. Sometimes Mrs. Clarke in the kitchen lets Mario ring a triangle with a steel ladle while she rolls back the dining-room doors. They make the servers wear hairnets and little Ob/Gynish gloves. Hal could take out the plug and nip down into the tunnels maybe not even all the way down into the Pump Room. Be only twenty minutes late. He's thinking in an abstract absent way about limits and rituals listening to Blott give Beak his aperçu. Like as in is there a clear line a quantifiable difference between need and just strong desire. He has to sit up to spit in the wastebasket. There is a twinge in a tooth on his mouth's left side. MARIO INCANDENZA'S FIRST AND ONLY EVEN REMOTELY ROMANTIC EXPERIENCE THUS FAR In mid-October Y.D.A.U. Hal had invited Mario for a post-prandial stroll and they were strolling the E.T.A. grounds between the West Courts and the hillside's tree-line Hal with his gear bag. Mario could sense that Hal wanted to be able to go off by himself briefly so he contrived (Mario did) to be very interested in some sort of leaf-and-twig ensemble off the path and let Hal sort of melt away down the path. The whole area running along the tree-line and the thickets of like shrubbery and stickery bushes and heaven knew what all was covered with fallen leaves that were dry but had not yet quite all the way lost their color. The leaves were underfoot. Mario kind of tottered from tree to tree pausing at each tree to rest. It was @ 1900h. not yet true twilight but the only thing left of the sunset was a snout just over Newton and the places under long shadows were cold and a certain kind of melancholy sadness was insinuating itself into the grounds' light. The staggered lamps by the paths hadn't come on yet however. A lovely scent of illegally burned leaves wafting up from East Newton mixed with the foody smells from the ventilator turbines out of the back of the dining hall. Two gulls were in one place in the air over the dumpsters over by the rear parking lot. Leaves crackled underfoot. The sound of Mario walking in dry leaves was like: crackle crackle crackle stop; crackle crackle crackle stop. An Empire Waste Displacement displacement vehicle whistled past overhead rising in the start of its arc its one blue alertlight atwinkle. He was around where the tree-line bulged herniatically out toward the end of the West Courts' fencing. From deeper inside the thickets on the lip of the hillside came a tremendous crackling and thrashing of underbrush and trailing willow-branches and who should heave into unexpected view but the U.S.S. Millicent Kent a sixteen-year-old out of Montclair NJ #1 Singles on the Girls 16's-A squad and two hundred kilos if she was a kilo. Southpaw one-hander off the backhand side a serve Donnie Stott likes to clock with radar and chart. Mario's filmed the U.S.S. Millicent Kent for staff-analysis on several occasions. They exchange hearty Hi's. One of only a couple female E.T.A.s with visible veins in her forearms object of a fiercely-wagered-on bench-press challenge against Schacht Freer and Pe-tropolis Kahn that M. Pemulis had organized last spring in which she'd topped Kahn and Freer refused to show and Schacht finally beat her but doffed his cap. Out for a staff-ordered weightmanagement post-dinner stroll squeezing Penn 5's in both hands in E.T.A. sweat pants and with an enormous violet bow either Scotch-taped or glued to the blunt rounded top of her hair. She told Mario she'd just seen the strangest thing farther back deeper in the thickets off the lip. Her hair was tall and rounded off in the shape of a kind of pill not unlike a papal hat or a British constable's tall hat. Mario said the bow looked terrific and what a surprise to come face to face like this out here in the chill dusk. Bridget Boone had said the U.S.S. Milli-cent Kent's coiffure looked like a missile protruding from its silo in preparation for launch. The last of the sun's snout was setting just over the tip of the U.S.S. Millicent's hair which was almost osseously hardlooking composed of dense woven nests of reticulate fibers like a dry loofa sponge which she said over the summer a home-perm had misfired and left her hair a system of reticulate nests and was only now loosening up enough even to attach a bow to. Mario said that well the bow set her off to a T was all he had to say on the matter. (He hadn't literally said 'chill dusk.') The U.S.S.M.K. said she'd been amusing herself beating her way through one of the brambly thickets Mrs. Incandenza had — when she'd still spent time outdoors at all — planted to discourage part-time employees from short-cutting up the hillside to E.T.A. and had come upon a Husky Vl-brand telescoping tripod new and dully silvery-looking and set up on its three legs right in the middle of the thicket. For no visible reason and with no footprints or visible evidence of path-beating anywhere around except the U.S.S. Millicent's own. The U.S.S. Millicent Kent stowed a tennis ball in each hip pocket and took Mario's claw and said here to walk this way and she'd show him real quick and get his like feedback on the issue and plus have a witness when they got back and she told people about it. Mario said the Husky VI came with its own pan head and cable release. With the girl supporting him with one hand and beating an easement through the brush with the other they proceeded deeper into the thicket on the lip. The outdoor light was now the same hue as U.S.S.M.K.'s hairbow. She said she swore to God it was around here someplace. Mario said his late dad had used a somewhat less snazzy IV-model Husky back in his early days of making art-films when he also used a homemade dolly and sandbags and halogen spots instead of kliegs. Several different species and types of birds were twittering. The U.S.S. Millicent Kent told Mario that off the record she'd always felt he had the longest lushest prettiest lashes of any boy on two continents three if you counted Australia. Mario thanked her kindly calling her Ma'am and trying to fake a Southern accent. The U.S.S. Millicent Kent said she wasn't sure what were her old footprints from finding the thicket with the tripod and what were their more recent footprints from trying to find the old footprints and that she was worried because it was starting to get dark and they might not be able to find it and then Mario wouldn't believe she'd seen something as batshit-sounding as a gleaming silvery tripod all set up for no reason in the middle of nowheresville. Mario said he was pretty sure that Australia was a continent. Walking he came up to around the bottom of U.S.S. Millicent's ribcage. Mario heard crackling and thrashing from some other thicket nearby but was certain it wasn't Hal since Hal very rarely made a lot of motion-noise either outside or in-. The U.S.S. Millicent Kent told Mario that though she was an admittedly great player w/ an overwhelming haul-ass-up-to-thenet-and-loom-over-it-like-a-titan game in the Betty Stove/Venus Williams power-game tradition and headed for an almost limitless future in the Show she'd confide in him in private out here that she'd never really loved competitive tennis that her real love and passion was modern interpretive dance at which she admittedly had less unconsciously native gifts and talents to bring to bear but which she loved and had spent just about all her off-court time as a little girl practicing in a leotard in front of a double-width mirror in her room at home in suburban Montclair NJ but that tennis was what she had limitless talent at and got emotional strokes and tuition-waiver boarding-school offers in and that she'd been desperate to get into a boarding school. Mario asked if she could recall if the Husky-VI tripod had been the TL one with waffle-gridded rubber tips on the legs and a 360° pan head or the SL one with unwaffled tips and only a 180° pan head that swiveled in an arc instead of a full circle. The U.S.S. Millicent revealed that she'd accepted a scholarship to E.T.A. at age nine for the sole reason of getting away from her father. She referred to her father as her Old Man which you can just tell she capitalizes. Her mother had left home when the U.S.S. Millicent was only five running off very abruptly with a man sent by what had then been called Con-Edison to do a free home-energyefficiency assessment. It had been six years since she'd laid an eyeball on her Old Man but to the best of her recall he was almost three meters tall and morbidly obese which had been why every mirror and bathtub in the house had been double-width. One older sister who'd been deeply involved in synchronized swimming had got pregnant and married in high school soon after her mother's departure. All this time there's been more crackling and crashing off up the hillside. Mario has trouble on any kind of declined grade. Some sort of bird's sitting in the top branch of a little tree and looking at them without saying anything. Mario thinks suddenly of a joke he remembers hearing Michael Pemulis tell: 'If two people get married in West Virginia and then pull up stakes and move to Massachusetts and then if they decide they want to get a divorce what's the biggest problem getting a divorce?’ The U.S.S.M.K. says her other older sister had at just fifteen joined the Ice Capades of all things and was in the back-up-like chorus where the biggest artistic challenge was not bumping into people and either falling or making them fall. 'Getting a divorce from your sister because in West Virginia Pemulis said a lot of people who get married are brother and sister.’ 'Hold my hand.’ 'He was only joking though.’ By now the light was about the same color as the ash and clinkers in the bottom of a Weber Grill. The U.S.S. Millicent Kent was leading them in a set of slightly diminishing circles. Then she said at age eight she came home early from after-school drills at the U.S.T.A. Jr. Facility in Passaic NJ looking forward to slipping into the old leotard and getting in some modern interpretive dancing up in her room only to come home suddenly and find her father wearing her leotard. Which needless to say didn't fit very well. And with the small front portion of his huge bare feet squeezed into a pair of strapless pumps Mrs. Kent had left behind in her haste. In the dining room he'd moved all the furniture over to the side of in front of the really wide mirror in a grotesquely tiny and bulging violet leotard capering. Mario says violet's really the U.S.S. Millicent's color. She says that was the exact creepy word for it: capering. Pirouetting and rondelling. Simpering as well. The crotch of her leotard looked like a slingshot it was so deformed. He hadn't heard her come in. U.S.S. Millicent asked Mario if he'd ever seen a girl's yin-yang before. Obscene mottled hirsute flesh had pooched and spilled out over every centimeter of the leotard's perimeter she recalled. She'd had a voluptuous figure even at eight she told Mario but the Old Man was in a whole different-sized ballpark altogether. Mario kept saying Golly Ned all he could think of to say. His flesh jiggled and bounced as he capered. It was repellent she said. There was no sign of a Husky VI or any other model of tripod in any of the thickets and boscages. Her literal term for it was 'yin-yang.' But her Old Man wasn't just a cross-dressing transves-tite she said; it turned out they always had to be a relative's female clothes. She said she always used to wonder why her sisters' one-pieces and figure-skating skirts always looked so askewly baggy and elastic-shot since the sisters didn't exactly wear tiny little malnourished sizes themselves. The Old Man didn't hear her come in and he capered and jetéed for several more minutes until she happened to catch his simpering eye in the mirror she said. That's when she knew she had to get away she said. And Mario's own old man's Admissions lady had called out of the blue that very evening she said. Like it had been fate. Serendipity. Kismet. 'Yin-yang' Mario offered nodding. The U.S.S. Millicent's hand was large and hot and at the level of sogginess of a bathmat that's been used several times in a row in quick succession. Her second-oldest sister many years later had informed the U.S.S.M.K. that the first time anybody'd had any inklings about the Old Man was an episode when the older sister was very small and Mrs. K. had sewed her a special costume complete with gold-lame bow & arrow for playing Cupid in the school Valentine's Day pageant and the sister's school had got out early one day after an asbestos scare and she'd come unexpectedly home and found the Old Man in the basement rumpus room in tiny wings and hideously distended diaper striking a pose from a rather well-known Titian oil in the Met's High Renaissance Wing and had struggled with denial and own-perceptions-doubting for quite some time thereafter until a hysterical episode during rehearsals for an Ice Capades Valentine's Day number brought all the feelings surging up and broke the denial and the Ice Capades' Employee Assistance Office counselling staff helped her start to work it all through. At which point U.S.S. Míllícent stopped them in an unprickly thicket of what later turned out to be poison sumac and turned with a strange glint in the one eye that wasn't in pine-shadow and crushed Mario's large head to the area just below her breasts and said she needed to confess that Mario's eyelashes and vest with extendable police lock he used for staying upright in one place had for quite some time now driven her right around the bend with sensual feeling. What Mario perceived as a sudden radical drop in the prevailing temperature was in fact the U.S.S. Millicent Kent's sexual stimulation sucking tremendous quantities of ambient energy out of the air surrounding them. Mario's face was so squashed against the U.S.S. Millicent's thorax that he had to contort his mouth way out to the left to breathe. U.S.S.M.K.'s hairbow became detached and fluttered down through Mario's sightline like a giant crazed violet moth. U.S.S.M.K. was trying to undo Mario's corduroys but was frustrated by the complex system of snaps and fasteners at the bottom of his police lock's Velcro vest which overlapped his trouser's own fasteners and Mario tried to reconfigure his mouth somehow to both breathe and warn the U.S.S.M.K. that he was incredibly ticklish in the area of the bellybutton and directly below. He could now start to hear his brother Hal somewhere to the above and east calling Mario's name at a moderate volume. The U.S.S. Millicent Kent was saying there was no way Mario could be any more nervous than she was about what was happening between them. It's true that the sounds of Mario sucking air out of a severely leftward-contorted mouth could have been interpretable as the heavy breathing of sexual stimulation. It was when the U.S.S. Millicent wrapped one arm around his shoulder for leverage and forced her other hand up under the hem of the tight vest and then down inside the trousers and briefs rooting for a penis that Mario became so ticklish that he began to double up clearing his face of U.S.S. Millicent's front and laughing out loud in such a distinctive high-pitched way that Hal had no trouble beelining right upon them compromised though his navigational systems were after fifteen or so secret minutes alone in the fragrant pines. Mario later said it was just like when there was a word on the tip of your tongue that try as you might you can't remember until the exact second you stop trying and in it pops right into your head: it was when the three of them were walking together back up the hillside toward the tree-line's lip not trying to do anything but get back to Comm.-Ad. by the most direct route in the dark that they stumbled upon the cinematic tripod a dully glinting TL waffle-tipped Husky in the middle of what wasn't such a very tall or thick thicket at all. 30 APRIL — YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT Steeply said 'Choosing Boston as your Ops center after all which to us signifies: the place of the supposed Entertainment's origin.’ Marathe made a gesture of being willing to take time and play along if Steeply wished it. 'But also the city Boston U.S.A. has logic. Your closest city to the Convexity. Closest therefore to Quebec. Within as you say the distance of spit.' His wheelchair squeaked very slightly whenever he moved. An automobile horn somewhere between the city and themselves blew a sustained blast. It grew always colder down on the desert floor; they could feel this. He felt gratitude for his windbreaker. Steeply flicked some ashes from his cigarette with a coarse thumb-gesture that was not yet feminine. 'But we're not any more sure that they actually do have copies. Also does this quote "anti"-Entertainment the film's director supposedly made to counter the lethality: does it really also exist; this really could be some sort of game for you and the F.L.Q.4747 to hold out the promise of the anti-Entertainment as a chip for concessions. As some kind of remedy or antidote.’ 'Of this anti-film that antidotes the seduction of the Entertainment we have no evidence except craziness of rumors.’ Steeply used a technical interviewer's device of pretending to occupy himself with small physical chores of preening and hygiene delaying to have Marathe elaborate himself more fully. The lights of the city Tucson with their movements and twinkling made a globe of light such as on ceilings at les salles de danser in Val d'Or Quebec. Marathe's wife was dying slowly of ventricular restenosis.4848 He thought: die twice. Marathe said: 'And also why do they never send you into the field as yourself Steeply? This is to say in appearance. The last time you were — what is it I hope to say — a Negro for almost one year no?’ U.S.A. persons' shrugs are always as if trying to lift a heavy thing. 'Haitian' Steeply said. 'I was Haitian. Some negroid tendencies in the persona maybe.' Marathe listened to Steeply be silent. A U.S.A. coyote sounds more like a high-strung dog. The automobile's horn continued sounding to the men forlorn and somehow nautical out below in the dark. The feminine manner to examine the fingernails was to raise the whole hand's back into view instead of malely curling the nails in over the upturned palm; Marathe recalled knowing this from a very young age. Steeply would pick at the corners of his lip then for an interval change to examining the fingernails. His silences seemed always comfortable and contained. He was a competent operative. More cold air came odd eddied breezes up in over the shelf from the desert's floor puffs of sudden air as if from the turning of a volume's pages. His bare arms had the plucked-chicken look of chilled and bare skin in his grotesque sleeveless dress. Marathe had not been aware of when during the falling of night Steeply had removed the absurd sunglasses but decided the exact moment of this did not matter for reporting every word and gesture back to M. Fortier. Again the coyote and also another farther off perhaps to answer. The sounds were like that of a domestic dog being given low voltage. Les Assassins' M. Fortier and M. Broullîme and some others of his comrades-on-wheels believed Rémy Marathe to be eidetic near-perfect in recall and detail. Marathe who could remember several incidents of crucial observations he had failed to later recall knew this was not true. 30 APRIL — YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT Several times also Marathe called U.S.A. to Steeply 'Your walled nation' or 'Your murated nation.’ An oiled guru sits in yogic full lotus in Spandex and tank top. He's maybe forty. He's in full lotus on top of the towel dispenser just above the shoulder-pull station in the weight room of the Enfield Tennis Academy Enfield MA. Saucers of muscle protrude from him and run together so that he looks almost crustacean. His head gleams his hair jet-black and extravagantly feathered. His smile could sell things. Nobody knows where he comes from or why's he's allowed to stay but he's always in there sitting yogic about a meter off the rubberized floor of the weight room. His tank top says TRANSCEND in silkscreen; on the back it's got DEUS PRO-VIDEBIT in Day-Glo orange. It's always the same tank top. Sometimes the color of the Spandex leggings changes. This guru lives off the sweat of others. Literally. The fluids and salts and fatty acids. He's like a beloved nut. He's an E.T.A. institution. You do like maybe some sets of benches some leg-curls inclined abs crunches work up a good hot shellac of sweat; then if you let him lick your arms and forehead he'll pass on to you some little nugget of fitness-guru wisdom. His big one for a long time was: 'And the Lord said: Let not the weight thou wouldst pull to thyself exceed thine own weight.' His advice on conditioning and injury-prevention tends to be pretty solid is the consensus. His tongue is little and rough but feels good like a kitty's. It isn't like a faggy or sexual thing. Some of the girls let him too. He's harmless as they come. He supposedly went way back with Dr. Incandenza the Academy's founder in the past. Some of the newer kids think he's a creep and want him out of there. What kind of guru wears Spandex and lives off others' perspiration? they complain. God only knows what he does in there when the weight room's closed at night they say. Sometimes the newer kids who won't even let him near them come in and set the resistance on the shoulder-pull at a weight greater than their own weight. The guru on the towel dispenser just sits there and smiles and doesn't say anything. They hunker then and grimace and try to pull the bar down but like lo: the overweighted shoulder-pull becomes a chin-up. Up they go their own bodies toward the bar they're trying to pull down. Everyone should get at least one good look at the eyes of a man who finds himself rising toward what he wants to pull down to himself. And I like how the guru on the towel dispenser doesn't laugh at them or even shake his head sagely on its big brown neck. He just smiles hiding his tongue. He's like a baby. Everything he sees hits him and sinks without bubbles. He just sits there. I want to be like that. Able to just sit all quiet and pull life toward me one forehead at a time. His name is supposedly Lyle. It was yrstruly and C and Poor Tony that crewed that day and everything like that. The AM were wicked bright and us a bit sick however we scored our wake ups boosting some items at a sidewalk sale in the Harvard Squar where it were warm upping and the snow coming off onnings and then later Poor Tony ran across an old Patty citizen type of his old aquaintance from like the Cape and Poor Tony got over and pretended like he would give a blow job On The House and we got the citizen to get in his ride with us and crewed on him good and we got enough $ off the Patty type to get straightened out for true all day and crewed on him hard and C wanted we should elemonade the Patty's map for keeps and everything like that and take his ride to this understanding slope strip shop he knows in Chinatown but Poor Tony turns white as a shit and said by no means and put up an arguement and everything like that and we just left the type there in his vehicle off Mem Dr we broke the jaw for insentive not to eat no cheese and C insisted and was not 2Bdenied and took off one ear which there was a mess and everything like that and then C throws the ear away after in a dumster so yrstrulys' like so what was the exact pernt to that like. The dumster was with the dumsters out by Steves' donuts in the Enfield Squar. We go back to the Brighton Projects to cop and Roy Tony was always there on his bench in the Playground in late AM but now all the Project Nigers was awake and out in the Playground and it was tense but it was day time and everything like that and we cop half a bundle from Roy Tony and we go down to the library at Copley where we stash our personnel works when we crewed and went into the mensroom where there was severel works on the floor allready that early and got straight in the stall and C and yrstruly had a beef about who shot three and who got two and we made Poor Tony give us up his third bag and then but we had to cop for that nite and tomorrow AM still which was XMas and had to cop in advance its' a never ending strugle its' a full time job to stay straight and there is no vacation for XMas at anytime. Its' a fucking bitch of a life dont' let any body get over on you diffrent. And back we go to the Harvard Squar however on arrival Poor Tony wanted he should hang for lunch time with his red leather fags in the Bow&Arrow and pretty much I can tolerate fags when alone but together yrstruly I cant' fucking stand fags and yrstruly and C said fuck this shit and we screwed out and go up to the Central Squar where it was cool offing and the onnings re freezing and everything like that and snowing and boosted NyQuil at the CVS Drug where we go to the mop aile and employ a mophandle in tilting the mirror over the NyQuil aile and boosted NyQuil in Cs' coat and got messed up on NyQuil and scored a bookbag off a foran slope studn type kid on the Redline platform but it only had books and disks and the diskcase was fucking plastic and into a dumster with it it goes but also at this time we come up and run into Kely Vinoy that was working her corner by the dumster by Cheap-O records in the Squar by the email place and shes' dopesick having a conversession with Eckwus and an other man and Eckwus said he said Stokely Darkstar just got freetested again at the Fenway and confirmed a big Boot 8.8 hes' got the Virus for sure and Purpleboy said he said Dark-star said how if he was going down he didnt' give a shit and wasnt' going to give a shit if he gave some others the Virus thru trancemission and the Word was out&about dont' share Stokely Darkstars' works dont' use works off Stokely Darkstar no matter how sick you are even if your' dyng for it get other works. Like C said any thing would count in your mind when your' sick and had copped and was minus works and Darkstar had works. We all every crew with heads left have personnel works for only ourselves that we use except blownout old hose like Kely and Purpleboy there Man takes there $ and there works and Hes' the only one can give them there shots and keep Kely just this side of dopesick 24-7 for insentive for her to make him more $ and everything like that theres' nothing wurse than a Pimp and Boston Pimps are the wurst there' 10X wurse than NYC Pimps that are supperst to be so hartless in NYC where yrstruly petaled ass in the Columbus Squar for a time of my youth like Stokely Darkstar before departing for green pastures and we had a conversession but were' coming down and it was getting dark and snowing for a White XMas and if we didnt' crew before like 2200 Roy Tonys' Nigers would be too drunk to keep them from beefing with us and thered' be a beef and everything like that if we go to cop after 2200 and who needs a grief so back we Redline to the Harvard Squar and all the foran studns are in the bars and we locate Poor Tony smoking hash with fags back of Au Bon Pain and say lets roll a foran studn stuck here for XMas in the bars and cop before 2200 and so we all go on the ice from the frozen melted snow to the Bow&Arrow in the Squar with Poor Tony and Lolasister and Susan T. Cheese who I fucking cant' stand and got in there and made Susan T. Cheese buy beers and we wait and no studns are leaving alone to roll but a older type individual who any body could see is no studn but is legless on shots alone at the bar fucking shatered slumped over is getting ready to depart for green pastures and Poor Tony tells Lolasister to screw she crews with Poor Tony some times but not if its' wet work and with Cs' involvement its' always wet work and yrstruly I inform Susan T. Cheese she new better than not to screw as well and the older individual de parts shatered and holding onto walls in a hiclass and promising coat for the possibility of $ and pernts his old nose this way and that and everything like that thru the Bow&Arrow window C wipes the steam off and has a conversession with a Santaclaus ringing a big bell for the kettle and were' like Jesus its' a never ending strugle to wait and cop but after awhile finally after stifing the Santaclaus we watch he picks a direction finally at last up Mass Ave toward the Central Squar on foot and Poor Tony beats it around the block to get up in front of him around the block on the ice in his fucking heels and feather snake around his neck and gets him some how Poor Tony always knows how over to the dumsters' alley by Bay Bank off Sherman St and yrstruly and C crew on the individual and roll him and C messes up his older map to a large degree and we leave him in no condition to eat cheese in a snow drift of materil under the dumster and C again wants to siphon out a vehicle on Mass Av and set him on fire but he has 400 $ on his person and then some and a coat with a fury collar and a watch we realy scored and C even gosofar to take the non studns' shoes which they dont' fit and in the dumster they go. And but so but back we go to the Brighton Projects but its' post 2200 its’ too late Roy Tony hasnt' got his pissboys out hes' not open for comerce and yet it is like a Niger Convenssion in the Playground of the Brighton Projects with there glass pipes and there Crown Royal in purple bags and everything like that in the Playground of the Projects and if they smell were' holding this kindof $ amounts they will crew on us in numbers there' animals at nite with there purple velvet bags and p-dope and Redi Rok crack one large Niger in a Patriots hat has a hart incident and downhegoes on the black top by the swing set right in front of us and none of his brothers unquot gosofar to do any thing he lays there there' animals at nite and we screw out with rickytick speed from the Brighton Projects and we converse. And Poor Tony wants to just go over the line to the Enfield Squar and try and just cop p-dope from Delphina down by the Empire hangers or else what else hang with the fags at Steves' donuts and hear who else is holding weight in Enfield or Allston and everything like that but Delphinas' p is from bunk the Word is out&about that its' all Manitol and kwai9 you might as well fucking cop XLax or Schweppes and C dopeslaps Poor Tony and C wants to Redline down to Chinatown but Poor Tony turns white as a shit and says Chinatowns' too dear in $ and everything like that even for like bundles Dr. Wo is 200 $ but atleast its' always good and but we have 400 $ and then some and C pernts out we can fucking well afford Wos' well known exellent skeet for once at XMas and Poor Tony stamps a hiheel and says but how weve' got enough $ to stay straight and get Lolasister straight for XMas and all lay up and not have to never ending strugle at XMas and two or more days after that if we dont' blow it on XMas Eve in Chinatown instead of waiting which is a good pernt but when has any body known C to ever wait he gets dopesíck faster than us and everything like that and is all piss and vinegar for Wo and starting with the Shivers and with the noses' mucis all ready and everything like that and C is not 2Bdenied and we say we are screwing down to Chinatown and if Poor Tony dont' want to come he can take a like a giant breath and hold it in the Squar until we get back and well' cop for him and Poor Tony says he might be a dicksucking fag but hes' not a starry eyed' moroon. And so offwego and everything like that with 400 $ on the Orangeline and thru a fucked up circumstances yrstruly and C almost end up raping a older type nurse in a white nurses' uniform and coat on the train but we dont' and but Poor Tony seems white and detracted on the train playng with his feather snake and says he says he seems in his mind maybe to recall an involvment in some type deal where Dr. Wo might of got slightly got over on and burnt and that maybe down in Chinatown we could air on the side of low profiles and try to cop some where else except from the Wos'. Except Dr. Wo is who we know. C is Wos' former aquaintance from crewing with slopes on the North shore for Whity Sorkin in the days of his youth. C is not 2Bdenied. And so at the Orangeline Tstop we grab a fat cab to about two blocks from Hung Toys and screw out of the cab at a light and the thing with fat cabbies is they cant' run after you and Poor Tony is pisser to watch tearassing it down the street in hiheels with a feather stoal. Poor Tony runs right by the front of Hung Toys this is by pryor agreement to wait for us low profile down the street and yrstruly and C go in Hung Toys where they dont' open till 2300 and sell tea unquot like 100 Proof tea till all hours and everything like that and never get Inspected because Dr. Wo has arrangements with Chinatowns' Finest. XMas is noncelebrated in Chinatown. Dr. Wo a good thing about Wo is hes' always there in Hung Toys at known times. Here theres' all old slope racial type ladies sitting in booths eating noddles and drinking quot tea out of white cups the size of a shotglass and everything like that. With small slope kids tearassing it all over and older men in like jew caps and skinny beerds out of just the middle of there chin but Dr. Wo is only middle aged and wears iron glasses and a tie and looks more like a banker for a slope but he is 100 % business and icecold all the way down for slope type comerce plus hes' connected bigtime and not to be fucked or got over on if some body has a head left and yrstruly I cant' believe Poor Tony would ever take part of tryng to crew on Wo who he knows thru C in even the smallest comerce and if he did C says he sure never heard about it nor saw any of the skeet or anything like that and why. Cs' the one that knows Wo. We arranged Poor Tony to wait for us out side and try to be low profile. Its' sub 0 snow and hes' in a leather spring coat and stoal and brown wig thats' not as good as a hat and hell' freeze his low profile balls off and C was tryng to smile and he told Dr. Wo we needed three bundles and Dr. Wo was smiling in his slope manner said the boosting life must surely be exellent and C laughed and said most exellent Cs' tight with slopes he does the talking and everything like that and he says were' going to lay up low profile for the XMas vacation and not crew because I had a rape type situation from an older nurse last nite on the T and almost got pinched by the Ts' Finest and Dr. Wo nods in a special subservant manner he uses for non slopes who hes' realy polite with but hes' a dictater to his slopes when we see him with his subservant slopes but with us were' allike most polite and everything like conversession and its' nice but expensive but it feels nice at the time but Wo finishes his so called tea and Wo goes back behind the curtains in the back of Hung Toys thats' a giant brightred curtain with purple mountains or hills and clouds that are flyng snakes with leather wings that is one curtain yrstruly would want to boost for personnel hanging use that no body that isnt' a slope and isnt' in with Wo cant' never go behind it but you can see when he opens it and goes behind the curtain it looks like merly more old slope ladies sitting on packing cases with slope writing eating more noddles in bowls they hold about like a millmeter from their yellow maps and everything like that. Slopes rarly stop shovling in the old noddles. Stokely Darkstar calls them maggoteaters and subservant slopes keep going in and out of the curtain while Wos' back there a longer than avrege time and Cs' got the Shivers and starting to jones and dope-fiends are full of super station and he says to yrstruly he says the fuck he says maybe what if Poor Tony realy did take part with burning Wo and what if a slope sees Poor Tony out side and is one of these slopes going in and out of the curtain maybe telling Wo like ratting out Poor Tony as our aquaintance and my muds is starting and were' jonesing super statiously over PT and wheres' Wo behind the curtain and everything like that tryng to smile and conversession ultralow drinking quot tea thats' like schnapps only wurse and green. And we jones and Dr. Wo comes back finally at last out smiling subservantly with all the wonderful skeet three bundles in a newspaper who could fucking read it but the pictures are of slope VIPs' in suits and Wo sits down and Wo never sits down at the booth with the skeet it isnt' done in his comerce and Wos' hands are folded over our skeet in the thing and Wo smiling says he asks C if weve' seen goodold Poor Tony or Susan T. Cheese around we crew with Poor Tony in boosting life did we not he said. C he says PT is a fucking dicksucking fag queer and a proven cheeseater and wed' fucked up his map and Cheese and Lolasisters' map in a beef and didnt' crew with fags since aprox the autum period. C is pouring mucis and tryng to smile cusually Dr. Wo laughed in a harty fashion and said exellent and Wo leaned over our skeet sayng if we should happenbychance to see Poor Tony or them to please give Poor Tony his quite best regards and wish him prosparity and a thousand blisses. And everything like that. And we promote the newspaper of skeet and Wo promotes our $ and very politely outwego and I admit it yrstruly wanted we should burn Poor Tony and rickytick the fuck out of Chinatown but we go over down more by the China Pearl Place and Poor Tony is sortof hunched behind a lightpoal with his gray teeth chatting in his dress and thin coat tryng to be low profile in his red coat and heels around a million + slopes that all are subservants of Wo. And later after screwing out we didnt' tell him of what Wo said about sitting down and asking about him and Cheeses' blisses and we screw to the Orangeline to our hot air blowergrate we use at nite at the library behind the Copley Squar and we get our personnel works out from behind the brickworks behind the bush by the hot blowergrate where we stash our works and were' eggerly into the first bundle and were' cooking up and notice Poor Tony doesnt' the least bitch when yrstruly and C tie off first in line seeing as were' the ones that copped it and Poor Tonys' gotto wait as usal except I notice he doesnt' bitch even a little normally Poor Tony keeps up this usal wine yrstruly learned how to not notice but when he doesnt' wine now that were' jonesing and the skeets' right there I notice hes' cusually looking like every place but at the skeet which is unusal and C jonesing and with the Shivers cooking up tryng to keep his lighter lit in the hot airs' wind and snow of nite and I admit it yrstruly I get a wicked cold inside feeling even with all this hot air from the blowergrate blowing up from under us and making our hair blow around and Tonys' feather snake pernt upword I yrstruly get a cold feeling of super station once more you get wicked super stations in this fucked up kindof shit life because its' a never ending chase and you get too tired to go by much more than never ending habit and super station and everything like that so but I dont' say any thing but yrstruly I have a cold super station about Poor Tony not wining while he makes like he has to cusually piss and takes a piss and the piss steams up around the lower ares of the bush with his back turned away and isnt' looking around with interst or anything like that you never turn your back on the skeet when its' partly your skeet which is wicked unusal which C is so eggerly dopesick he doesnt' notice any thing past keeping the lighter lit. And so I admit it I yrstruly did yrstruly purplously let C tie off and boot up first while I still cooked up I did cook up unusally slow fucking with the getting the snowmelt hot in the spoon and everything like that yrstruly I let the lighter go out and took more time with the cotton and C had the Shivers wurst of us and cooks up the fastest and would of got it anyway. Later with Cs' map elemonaded Poor Tony later conceited admitting Susan T. Cheese helped a Worcester fag get over on Wo for a fronted bundle in autum is why. And all three bundles Wo give us in slope news was Hotshots. Laced. It started the instantly C undid the belt and booted up we knew allready yrstruly I and PT thearized it was Drano with the blue like glittershit and everything like that taken out by subservant slopes it had that Drano like effect on C and everything like that it was laced what ever it was C started with the screaming in a loud hipitch fashion instantly after he unties and boots and downhegoes flopping with his heels pouning on the metal of the blower-grate and hes' at his throat with his hands tearing at him self in the most fucked up fashions and Poor Tony is hiheeling rickytick over over C zipping up sayng he screams sweety C but and stuffing the feather snake from his necks' head in Cs' mouth to shut him up from hipitch screaming in case Bostons' Finest can hear involvment and blood and bloody materil is coming out Cs' mouth and Cs' nose and its' allover the feathers its' a sure sign of Drano blood is and Cs' eyes get beesly and bulge and hes' cryng blood into the feathers in his mouth and tryng to hold onto my glove but Cs' arms are going allover and one eye it like allofa sudden pops outof his map like with a Pop you make with fingers in your mouth with all this blood and materil and a blue string at the back of the eye and the eye falls over the side of Cs' map and hangs there looking at the fag Poor Tony. And C turned lightblue and bit thru the snakes' head and died for keeps and shit his pants instanly with shit so bad the hot air blowergrate is blowing small bits of fart and blood and missty shit up into our maps and Poor Tony backs offof over C and puts his hands over his madeup map and looks at C thru his fingers. And yrstruly I take the belt off it goes without saying and dont' even rethink or dream about tryng maybe a diffrent bag out of a diffrent bundle from C for how could Wo know what bundle wed' cook up outof first so all three bundles must be Hot so I dont' even dream even tho yrstrulys' Shiverng and mucis sick allready and now in payback Wo has our only $ to get straight with for XMas. It might sound fucking low but the reason we had to leave the decesed body C in one of the librarys' dumsters is the reason is because the Copley Squars' Finest know it is our personnel hot air blowergrate and if we leave C there its' a sure pinch for us as known aquain-tance and a period of Kicking The Bird in holding in a cell but the dumster was empty of materil and Cs' head made a fucked up sound when it hit the empty bottom and Poor Tony cried and wined and said he said he had no inkling that beast Wo was that vindicative and poorold decesed C and how this was it hes' going to get clean from heronout and get a straightjob dancing in a Patty type Club in the Fenway and everything like that on and on piss and wine. I didnt' say any thing. I had to rethink on the T to the Squar if yrstruly I should elemonade Poor Tonys' map for keeps for payback on how he purplously lets C shoot up first and wouldof let yrstruly shoot first even knowing or make that cheese move and go back down the Orangeline to Wo and try and get enough bags to get true straight eating cheese to Wo about the wherehouse that Poor Tony and Susan T. Cheese and Lolasister with Eckwus crashed at now. Or like what. Yrstruly I almost was cryng. It was when Poor Tony took off his hiheels and wanted yrstruly I should boost him like over the edge of Cs' bodies' dumster to get back what was left of his feather stoal out of Cs' mouth that yrstruly I thought I decided what to do. But the connected slope Wo wasnt' even there in front of the Hung Toys curtain in the early XMas AM and then Poor Tony departed for green pastures and ate cheese and it took yrstruly two days of Kicking The Bird in the hall out side my Mumsters' apartment that for payback she locked the door before I yrstruly can get in a Detox to atleast cop some methedoan and get three squars to stay down in yrstruly to start to thearize on what to try and do after I could standup straight and walk upright again once more. 3 NOVEMBER Y.D.A.U. Hal could hear the phone console ringing as he dropped his gear bag and took the room key from around his neck. The phone itself had been Orin's and its plastic case was transparent and you could see the phone's guts. 'Mmyellow.’ 'Why do I always get the feeling I'm interrupting you in the middle of some like vigorous self-abuse session?' It was Orin's voice. 'It's always multiple rings. Then you're always a little breathless when you do.’ 'Do what.’ 'A certain sweaty urgency to your voice. Are you one of the 99% of adolescent males Hallie?’ Hal never liked talking on the phone after he'd gotten high in secret down in the Pump Room. Even if there was water or liquid handy to keep the cotton at bay. He didn't know why this was so. It just made him uneasy. 'You're sounding hale and fit O.’ 'You can tell me you know. No shame in it. Let me tell you boy I did myself raw for years on end on that hill.’ Hal estimated over 60% of what he told Orin on the phone since Orin had abruptly started calling again this spring was a lie. He had no idea why he liked lying to Orin on the phone so much. He looked at the clock. 'Where are you?’ 'Home. Snug and toasty. It's 90+ out.’ 'That would be Fahrenheit I'm assuming.’ 'This city is made of all glass and light. The windows are like high-beams coming at you. The air has that spilled-fuel shimmer to it.’ 'So to what do we owe.’ 'Sometimes I wear sunglasses even in the house. Sometimes at the stadium I hold my hand up and look at it and I swear I can see right through it. Like that thing with the flashlight and your hand.’ 'Hands seem to be sort of a theme to this call thus far.’ 'On the way in from the lot off the street here I saw a pedestrian in a pith helmet stagger and like claw at the air and pitch forward onto his face. Another Phoenician felled by the heat I think to myself.’ It occurred to Hal that although he lied about meaningless details to Orin on the phone it had never occurred to him to consider whether Orin was ever doing the same thing. This induced a spell of involuted marijuana-type thinking that led quickly again to Hal's questioning whether or not he was really all that intelligent. 'SATs are six weeks away and Pemulis is less and less helpful on the math if you want to know what I'm doing all day.’ 'The man's face made a sizzling noise when it hit the pavement. Like bacon-caliber sizzling. He's still lying there I see out the window. He's not moving anymore. Everyone's avoiding him going around him. He looks too hot to touch. A little Hispanic kid made off with his hat. Have y'all had snow yet? Describe snow for me again Hallie I'm begging you.’ 'So you go around with this image of me sitting around during the day masturbating is what you're saying.’ 'I've actually been thinking of maneuvering for the whole Kleenex concession at E.T.A. as a venture.’ 'That of course would mean actually contacting C.T. and the Moms.’ 'Me and this forward-looking reserve QB have been making inquiries. Putting out feelers. Volume discounts preferred-vendor status. Maybe a sideline in unscented lubricants. Any thoughts?’ 'O.?’ 'I'm sitting here actually missing New Orleans kid. It'd be just coming up on Advent I think. The Quarter always gets really quaint and demure during Advent. It almost never rains down there during Advent for some reason. People remark on it the phenomena.’ 'You sound somehow a little off to me O.’ Tm heat-crazed. I might be dehydrated. What's that word? Everything's looked all beige and powdery all day. Trash bags have been swelling up and spontaneously combusting out in the dumpsters. These sudden rains of coffee grounds and orange peels. The Displacement guys in the barges have to wear asbestos gloves. Also I met somebody. Hallie a possibly very special somebody.’ 'Uh oh. Dinnertime. Triangle's a-clangín' over in West.’ 'Hey Halíie though? Hang on. Kidding aside for a second. What all do you know about Separatism?’ Hal stopped for a moment. 'You mean in Canada?’ 'Is there any other kind?’ Ennet House Drug and Alcohol Recovery House4949 was founded in the Year of the Whopper by a nail-tough old chronic drug addict and alcoholic who had spent the bulk of his adult life under the supervision of the Massachusetts Department of Corrections before discovering the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous at M.D.C.-Walpole and undergoing a sudden experience of total self-surrender and spiritual awakening in the shower during his fourth month of continuous AA sobriety. This recovered addict/ alcoholic — who in his new humility so valued AA's tradition of anonymity that he refused even to use his first name and was known in Boston AA simply as the Guy Who Didn't Even Use His First Name — opened Ennet House within a year of his parole determined to pass on to other chronic drug addicts and alcoholics what had been so freely given to him in the E-Tier shower. Ennet House leases a former physicians' dormitory in the Enfield Marine Public Health Hospital Complex managed by the United States Veterans Administration. Ennet House is equipped to provide 22 male and female clients a nine-month period of closely supervised residency and treatment. Ennet House was not only founded but originally renovated furnished and decorated by the nameless local AA ex-con who — since sobriety doesn't exactly mean instant sainthood — used to lead select teams of early-recovery dope fiends on after-hours boosting expeditions at area furniture and housewares establishments. This legendary anonymous founder was an extremely tough old Boston AA galoot who believed passionately that everyone no matter how broad the trail of slime they dragged in behind them deserved the same chance at sobriety through utterly total surrender he'd been granted. It's a kind of extremely tough love found almost exclusively in tough old Boston galoots.5050 He sometimes the founder in the House's early days required incoming residents to attempt to eat rocks — as in like rocks from the ground — to demonstrate their willingness to go to any lengths for the gift of sobriety. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health's Division of Substance Abuse Services eventually requested that this practice be discontinued. Ennet was not any part of the nameless Ennet House founder's name by the way. The rock thing — which has become a grim bit of mythopoeia now trotted out to illustrate how cushy the present Ennet residents have it — was probably not as whacko as it seemed to Division of S.A.S. since many of the things veteran AA's ask newcomers to do and believe seem not much less whacko than trying to chew feldspar. E.g. be so strung out you can feel your pulse in your eyeballs have the shakes so badly you make a spatter-painting on the wall every time somebody hands you a cup of coffee have the life-forms out of the corner of your eye be your only distraction from the chainsaw-racing chatter in your head sitting there and have some old lady with cat-hair on her nylons come at you to hug you and tell you to make a list of all the things you're grateful for today: you'll wish you had some feldspar handy too.

In block #3 of the accident reporting form I put "trying to do the job alone" as the cause of my accident. You said in your letter that I should explain more fully and I trust that the following details will be sufficient. I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident March 27 I was working alone on the roof of a new six story building. When I completed my work I discovered that I had about 900 kg. of brick left over. Rather than laboriously carry the bricks down by hand I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley which fortunately was attached to the side of the building at the sixth floor. Securing the rope at ground level I went up to the roof swung the barrel out and loaded the brick into it. Then I went back to the ground and untied the rope holding it tightly to insure a slow descent of the 900 kg of bricks. You will note in block #11 of the accident reporting form that I weigh 75 kg. Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third floor I met the barrel coming down. This explains the fractured skull and the broken collar bone. Slowed only slightly I continued my rapid ascent not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulleys. Fortunately by this time I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope in spite of considerable pain. At approximately the same time however the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel from the force of hitting the ground. Devoid of the weight of the bricks the barrel now weighed approximately 30 kg. I refer you again to my weight of 75 kg in block #11. As you could imagine still holding the rope I began a rather rapid descent from the pulley down the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third floor I met the barrel coming up. This accounts for the two fractured ankles and the laceration of my legs and lower body. The encounter with the barrel slowed me enough to lessen my impact with the brick-strewn ground below. I am sorry to report however that as I lay there on the bricks in considerable pain unable to stand or move and watching the empty barrel six stories above me I again lost my presence of mind and unfortunately let go of the rope causing the barrel to begin a endtranslNTCOM626 HAL INCANDENZA'S FIRST EXTANT WRITTEN COMMENT ON ANYTHING EVEN REMOTELY FILMIC SUBMITTED IN MR.

Chief Steve McGarrett of 'Hawaii Five-0' and Captain Frank Furillo of 'Hill Street Blues' are useful for seeing how our North American idea of the hero changed from the B.S. 1970s era of 'Hawaii Five-0' to the B.S. 1980s era of 'Hill Street Blues.’ Chief Steve McGarrett is a classically modern hero of action. He acts out. It is what he does. The camera is always on him. He is hardly ever offscreen. He has just one case per week. The audience knows what the case is and also knows by the end of Act One who is guilty. Because the audience knows the truth before Steve McGarrett does there is no mystery there is only Steve McGarrett. The drama of 'Hawaii Five-0' is watching the hero in action watching Steve McGarrett stalk and strut homing in on the truth. Homing in is the essence of what the classic hero of modern action does. Steve McGarrett is not weighed down by administrative State-Políce-Chief chores or by females or friends or emotions or any sorts of conflicting demands on his attention. His field of action is bare of diverting clutter. Thus Chief Steve McGarrett single-mindedly acts to refashion a truth the audience already knows into an object of law justice modern heroism. In contrast Captain Frank Furillo is what used to be designated a 'post'-modern hero. Viz. a hero whose virtues are suited to a more complex and corporate American era. I.e. a hero of reaction. Captain Frank Furillo does not investigate cases or singlemindedly home in. He commands a precinct. He is a bureaucrat and his heroism is bureaucratic with a genius for navigating cluttered fields. In each broadcast episode of 'Hill Street Blues' Captain Frank Furillo is beset by petty distractions on all sides from the very beginning of Act One. Not one but eleven complex cases each with suspects and snitches and investigating officers and angry community leaders and victims' families all clamoring for redress. Hundreds of tasks to delegate egos to massage promises to make promises from last week to keep. Two or three cops' domestic troubles. Payroll vouchers. Duty logs. Corruption to be tempted by and agonized over. A Police Chief who's a political parody a hyperactive son an ex-wife who haunts the frosted-glass cubicle that serves as Frank Furillo's office (whereas Steve McGarrett's B.S. 1970s office more closely resembled the libraries of landed gentry hushed behind two heavy doors and wainscot-ted in thick tropical oak) plus a coldly attractive Public Defendress who wants to talk about did this suspect get Mirandized in Spanish and can Frank stop coming too soon he came too soon again last night maybe he should get into some kind of stress counselling. Plus all the weekly moral dilemmas and double binds his even-handed bureaucratic heroism gets Captain Frank Furillo into. Captain Frank Furillo of 'Hill Street Blues' is a 'post'-modern hero a virtuoso of triage and compromise and administration. Frank Furillo retains his sanity composure and superior grooming in the face of a barrage of distracting unheroic demands that would have left Chief Steve McGarrett slumped unkempt and chewing his knuckle in administrative confusion. In further contrast to Chief Steve McGarrett Captain Frank Furillo is rarely filmed tight or full-front. He is usually one part of a frenetic moving pan by the program's camera. In contrast 'Hawaii Five-o' 's camera crew never even used a dolly favoring a steady tripodic close-up on McGar-rett's face that today seems more reminiscent of romantic portraiture than filmed drama. What kind of hero comes after McGarrett's Irishized modern cowboy the lone man of action riding lonely herd in paradise? Furillo's is a whole different kind of loneliness. The 'post'-modern hero was a heroic part of the herd responsible for all of what he is part of responsible to everyone his lonely face as placid under pressure as a cow's face. The jut-jawed hero of action ('Hawaii Five-0') becomes the mild-eyed hero of reaction ('Hill Street Blues' a decade later). And as we have observed thus far in our class we as a North American audience have favored the more Stoic corporate hero of reactive probity ever since some might be led to argue 'trapped' in the reactive moral ambiguity of 'post-' and 'post-post'- modern culture. But what comes next? What North American hero can hope to succeed the placid Frank? We await I predict the hero of «o«- action the catatonic hero the one beyond calm divorced from all stimulus carried here and there across sets by burly extras whose blood sings with retrograde amines. ENORMOUS ELECTROLYSIS-RASHED 'JOURNALIST' 'HELEN’ STEEPLY'S ONLY PUTATIVE PUBLISHED ARTICLE BEFORE BEGINNING HER SOFT PROFILE ON PHOENIX CARDINALS PUNTER ORIN J. INCANDENZA AND HER ONLY PUTATIVE PUBLISHED ARTICLE TO HAVE ANYTHING OVERTLY TO DO WITH GOOD OLD METROPOLITAN BOSTON 10 AUGUST IN THE YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT FOUR YEARS AFTER OPTICAL THEORIST ENTREPRENEUR TENNIS ACADEMICIAN AND AVANT-GARDE FILMMAKER JAMES O. INCANDENZA TOOK HIS OWN LIFE BY PUTTING HIS HEAD IN A MICROWAVE OVEN Moment Magazine has learned that the tragic fate of the second North American citizen to receive a Jarvik IX Exterior Artificial Heart has sadly been kept from the North American people. The woman a 46-year-old Boston accountant with irreversible restenosis of the heart responded so well to the replacement of her defective heart with a Jarvik IX Exterior Artificial Heart that within weeks she was able to resume the active lifestyle she had so enjoyed before stricken pursuing her active schedule with the extraordinary prosthesis portably installed in a stylish Etienne Aigner purse. The heart's ventricular tubes ran up to shunts in the woman's arms and ferried life-giving blood back and forth between her living active body and the extraordinary heart in her purse. Her tragic untimely and some might say cruelly ironic fate however has been the subject of the all too frequent silence needless tragedies are buried beneath when they cast the callous misunderstanding of public officials in the negative light of public knowledge. It took the sort of searching and fearless journalistic doggedness readers have come to respect in Moment to unearth the tragically negative facts of her fate. The 46-year-old recipient of the Jarvik IX Exterior Artificial Heart was actively window shopping in Cambridge Massachusetts' fashionable Harvard Square when a transvestíte purse snatcher a drug addict with a criminal record all too well known to public officials bizarrely outfitted in a strapless cocktail dress spike heels tattered feather boa and auburn wig brutally tore the life sustaining purse from the woman's unwitting grasp. The active alert woman gave chase to the purse snatching 'woman' for as long as she could plaintively shouting to passers by the words 'Stop her! She stole my heart!' on the fashionable sidewalk crowded with shoppers reportedly shouting repeatedly 'She stole my heart stop her!' In response to her plaintive calls tragically misunderstanding shoppers and passers by merely shook their heads at one another smiling knowingly at what they ignorantly presumed to be yet another alternative lifestyle's relationship gone sour. A duo of Cambridge Massachusetts patrolmen whose names are being withheld from Moment's dogged queries were publicly heard to passively quip 'Happens all the time' as the victimized woman staggered frantically past in the wake of the fleet transvestite shouting for help for her stolen heart. That the prosthetic crime victim gave spirited chase for over four blocks before collapsing onto her empty chest is testimony to the impressive capacity of the Jarvik IX replacement procedure was the anonymous comment of a public medical official reached for comment by Moment. The drug crazed purse snatcher informed officials passively speculated may have found even his hardened conscience moved by the life saving prosthesis the ill gotten woman's Aigner purse revealed which runs on the same rechargeable power cell as an electric man's razor and may well have continued to beat and bleed for a period of time in the rudely disconnected purse. The purse snatcher's response to this conscience appears to have been cruelly striking the Jarvik IX Exterior Artificial Heart repeatedly with a stone or small hammer-like tool where its remains were found some hours later behind the historic Boston Public Library in fashionable Copley Square. Is medical science's awe inspiring march forward however always doomed to include such tragic incidents of ignorance and callous loss one might ask. Such seems to be the stance of North American officials. If indeed so the victims' fate is frequently kept from the light of public knowledge. And the facts of the case's outcome? The 46-year-old deceased woman's formerly active alert brain was removed and dissected six weeks later by a Brigham and Women's City of Boston Hospital medical student reportedly so moved by her terse toe tag's account of the victim's heartless fate that he confessed to Moment a temporary inability to physically wield the power saw of his assigned task.

AND BUT SO WHY THE ABRUPT CONSUMER RETREAT BACK TO GOOD OLD VOICE-ONLY TELEPHONING? The answer in a kind of trivalent nutshell is: (1) emotional stress (2) physical vanity (3) a certain queer kind of selfobliterating logic in the microeconomics of consumer high-tech. fl) It turned out that there was something terribly stressful about visual telephone interfaces that hadn't been stressful at all about voice-only interfaces. Videophone consumers seemed suddenly to realize that they'd been subject to an insidious but wholly marvelous delusion about conventional voice-only telephony. They'd never noticed it before the delusion — it's like it was so emotionally complex that it could be countenanced only in the context of its loss. Good old traditional audio-only phone conversations allowed you to presume that the person on the other end was paying complete attention to you while also permitting you not to have to pay anything even close to complete attention to her. A traditional aural-only conversation — utilizing a handheld phone whose earpiece contained only 6 little pinholes but whose mouthpiece (rather significantly it later seemed) contained (62) or 36 little pinholes — let you enter a kind of highway-hypnotic semi-attentive fugue: while conversing you could look around the room doodle fine-groom peel tiny bits of dead skin away from your cuticles compose phone-pad haiku stir things on the stove; you could even carry on a whole separate additional sign-language-and-exaggerated-facial-expression type of conversation with people right there in the room with you all while seeming to be right there attending closely to the voice on the phone. And yet — and this was the retrospectively marvelous part — even as you were dividing your attention between the phone call and all sorts of other idle little fuguelike activities you were somehow never haunted by the suspicion that the person on the other end's attention might be similarly divided. During a traditional call e.g. as you let's say performed a close tactile blemishscan of your chin you were in no way oppressed by the thought that your phonemate was perhaps also devoting a good percentage of her attention to a close tactile blemish-scan. It was an illusion and the illusion was aural and aurally supported: the phone-line's other end's voice was dense tightly compressed and vectored right into your ear enabling you to imagine that the voice's owner's attention was similarly compressed and focused . . . even though your own attention was not was the thing. This bilateral illusion of unilateral attention was almost infantilely gratifying from an emotional standpoint: you got to believe you were receiving somebody's complete attention without having to return it. Regarded with the objectivity of hindsight the illusion appears arational almost literally fantastic: it would be like being able both to lie and to trust other people at the same time. Video telephony rendered the fantasy insupportable. Callers now found they had to compose the same sort of earnest slightly overintense listener's expression they had to compose for in-person exchanges. Those callers who out of unconscious habit succumbed to fuguelike doodling or pants-crease-adjustment now came off looking rude absentminded or childishly selfabsorbed. Callers who even more unconsciously blemish-scanned or nostril-explored looked up to find horrified expressions on the video-faces at the other end. All of which resulted in videophonic stress. Even worse of course was the traumatic expulsion-from-Eden feeling of looking up from tracing your thumb's outline on the Reminder Pad or adjusting the old Unit's angle of repose in your shorts and actually seeing your videophonic interfacee idly strip a shoelace of its gumlet as she talked to you and suddenly realizing your whole infantile fantasy of commanding your partner's attention while you yourself got to fugue-doodle and make little genital-adjustments was deluded and insupportable and that you were actually commanding not one bit more attention than you were paying here. The whole attention business was monstrously stressful video callers found. (2) And the videophonic stress was even worse if you were at all vain. I.e. if you worried at all about how you looked. As in to other people. Which all kidding aside who doesn't. Good old aural telephone calls could be fielded without makeup toupee surgical prostheses etc. Even without clothes if that sort of thing rattled your saber. But for the image-conscious there was of course no such answer-as-you-are informality about visual-video telephone calls which consumers began to see were less like having the good old phone ring than having the doorbell ring and having to throw on clothes and attach prostheses and do hairchecks in the foyer mirror before answering the door. But the real coffin-nail for videophony involved the way callers' faces looked on their TP screen during calls. Not their callers' faces but their own when they saw them on video. It was a three-button affair: after all to use the TP's cartridge-card's Video-Record option to record both pulses in a two-way visual call and play the call back and see how your face had actually looked to the other person during the call. This sort of appearance-check was no more resistible than a mirror. But the experience proved almost universally horrifying. People were horrified at how their own faces appeared on a TP screen. It wasn't just 'Anchorman's Bloat' that well-known impression of extra weight that video inflicts on the face. It was worse. Even with high-end TPs' high-def viewer-screens consumers perceived something essentially blurred and moist-looking about their phone-faces a shiny pallid indefiniteness that struck them as not just unflattering but somehow evasive furtive untrustworthy unlikable. In an early and ominous InterLace/G.T.E. focus-group survey that was all but ignored in a storm of entrepreneurial sci-fi-tech enthusiasm almost 60% of respondents who received visual access to their own faces during videophonic calls specifically used the terms untrustworthy unlikable or hard to like in describing their own visage's appearance with a phenomenally ominous 71 % of senior-citizen respondents specifically comparing their video-faces % to that of Richard Nixon during the Nixon-Kennedy debates of B.S. 1960. The proposed solution to what the telecommunications industry's psychological consultants termed Video-Physiognomic Dysphoria (or VPD) was of course the advent of High-Definition Masking; and in fact it was those entrepreneurs who gravitated toward the production of high-definition videophonic imaging and then outright masks who got in and out of the short-lived videophonic era with their shirts plus solid additional nets. Mask-wise the initial option of High-Definition Photographic Imaging — i.e. taking the most flattering elements of a variety of flattering multi-angle photos of a given phone-consumer and — thanks to existing image-configuration equipment already pioneered by the cosmetics and law-enforcement industries — combining them into a wildly attractive high-def broadcastable composite of a face wearing an earnest slightly overintense expression of complete attention — was quickly supplanted by the more inexpensive and byte-economical option of (using the exact same cosmetic-and-FBI software) actually casting the enhanced facial image in a form-fitting polybutylene-resin mask and consumers soon found that the high up-front cost of a permanent wearable mask was more than worth it considering the stress- and VFD-reduction benefits and the convenient Velcro straps for the back of the mask and caller's head cost peanuts; and for a couple fiscal quarters phone/cable companies were able to rally VPD-afflicted consumers' confidence by working out a horizontally integrated deal where free composite-and-masking services came with a videophone hookup. The high-def masks when not in use simply hung on a small hook on the side of a TP's phoneconsole admittedly looking maybe a bit surreal and discomfiting when detached and hanging there empty and wrinkled and sometimes there were potentially awkward mistaken-identity snafus involving multi-user family or company phones and the hurried selection and attachment of the wrong mask taken from some long row of empty hanging masks — but all in all the masks seemed initially like a viable industry response to the vanity-stress-and-Nixonian-facial-image problem. (2 and maybe also 3) But combine the natural entrepreneurial instinct to satisfy all sufficiently high consumer demand on the one hand with what appears to be an almost equally natural distortion in the way persons tend to see themselves and it becomes possible to account historically for the speed with which the whole high-def-videophonic-mask thing spiralled totally out of control. Not only is it weirdly hard to evaluate what you yourself look like like whether you're good-looking or not — e.g. try looking in the mirror and determining where you stand in the attractiveness-hierarchy with anything like the objective ease you can determine whether just about anyone else you know is good-looking or not — but it turned out that consumers' instinctively skewed self-perception plus vanity-related stress meant that they began preferring and then outright demanding videophone masks that were really quite a lot better-looking than they themselves were in person. High-def mask-entrepreneurs ready and willing to supply not just verisimilitude but aesthetic enhancement — stronger chins smaller eye-bags air-brushed scars and wrinkles — soon pushed the original mimetic-mask-entrepreneurs right out of the market. In a gradually unsubtlizing progression within a couple more sales-quarters most consumers were now using masks so undeniably better-looking on videophones than their real faces were in person transmitting to one another such horrendously skewed and enhanced masked images of themselves that enormous psychosocial stress began to result large numbers of phone-users suddenly reluctant to leave home and interface personally with people who they feared were now habituated to seeing their far-better-looking masked selves on the phone and would on seeing them in person suffer (so went the callers' phobia) the same illusion-shattering aesthetic disappointment that e.g. certain women who always wear makeup give people the first time they ever see them without makeup. The social anxieties surrounding the phenomenon psych-consultants termed Optimistically Misrepresentational Masking (or OMM) intensified steadily as the tiny crude first-generation videophone cameras' technology improved to where the aperture wasn't as narrow and now the higher-end tiny cameras could countenance and transmit more or less full-body images. Certain psychologically unscrupulous entrepreneurs began marketing full-body polybutylene and -urethane 2-D cutouts — sort of like the headless muscleman and bathing-beauty cutouts you could stand behind and position your chin on the cardboard neck-stump of for cheap photos at the beach only these full-body videophone-masks were vastly more high-tech and convincing-looking. Once you added variable 2-D wardrobe hair- and eye-color options various aesthetic enlargements and reductions etc. costs started to press the envelope of mass-market affordability even though there was at the same time horrific social pressure to be able to afford the very best possible masked 2-D body-image to keep from feeling comparatively hideous-looking on the phone. How long then could one expect it to have been before the relentless entrepreneurial drive toward an ever-better mousetrap conceived of the Transmittable Tableau (a.k.a. TT) which in retrospect was probably the really sharp business-end of the videophonic coffin-nail. With TTs facial and bodily masking could now be dispensed with altogether and replaced with the video-transmitted image of what was essentially a heavily doctored still-photograph one of an incredibly fit and attractive and well-turned-out human being someone who actually resembled you the caller only in such limited respects as like race and limb-number the photo's face focused attentively in the direction of the video-phonic camera from amid the sumptuous but not ostentatious appointments of the sort of room that best reflected the image of yourself you wanted to transmit etc. The Tableaux were simply high-quality transmission-ready photographs scaled down to diorama-like proportions and fitted with a plastic holder over the videophone camera not unlike a lens-cap. Extremely good-looking but not terrifically successful entertainment-celebrities — the same sort who in decades past would have swelled the cast-lists of infomercials — found themselves in demand as models for various high-end videophone Tableaux. Because they involved simple transmission-ready photography instead of computer imaging and enhancement the Tableaux could be mass-produced and commensurately priced and for a brief time they helped ease the tension between the high cost of enhanced body-masking and the monstrous aesthetic pressures videophony exerted on callers not to mention also providing employment for set-designers photographers airbrushers and infomercial-level celebrities hard-pressed by the declining fortunes of broadcast television advertising. (3) But there's some sort of revealing lesson here in the beyond-short-term viability-curve of advances in consumer technology. The career of videophony conforms neatly to this curve's classically annular shape: First there's some sort of terrific sci-fi-like advance in consumer tech — like from aural to video phoning — which advance always however has certain unforeseen disadvantages for the consumer; and then but the market-niches created by those disadvantages — like people's stressfully vain repulsion at their own videophonic appearance — are ingeniously filled via sheer entrepreneurial verve; and yet the very advantages of these ingenious disadvantage-compensations seem all too often to undercut the original high-tech advance resulting in consumer-recidivism and curve-closure and massive shirt-loss for precipitant investors. In the present case the stressand-vanity-compensations' own evolution saw video-callers rejecting first their own faces and then even their own heavily masked and enhanced physical likenesses and finally covering the video-cameras altogether and transmitting attractively stylized static Tableaux to one another's TPs. And behind these lens-cap dioramas and transmitted Tableaux callers of course found that they were once again stresslessly invisible unvainly makeup- and toupeeless and baggy-eyed behind their celebrity-dioramas once again free — since once again unseen — to doodle blemish-scan manicure crease-check — while on their screen the attractive intensely attentive face of the well-appointed celebrity on the other end's Tableau reassured them that they were the objects of a concentrated attention they themselves didn't have to exert. And of course but these advantages were nothing other than the once-lost and now-appreciated advantages of good old Bellera blind aural-only telephoning with its 6 and (62) pinholes. The only difference was that now these expensive silly unreal stylized Tableaux were being transmitted between TPs on high-priced video-fiber lines. How much time after this realization sank in and spread among consumers (mostly via phone interestingly) would any micro-econometrist expect to need to pass before high-tech visual videophony was mostly abandoned then a return to good old telephoning not only dictated by common consumer sense but actually after a while culturally approved as a kind of chic integrity not Ludditism but a kind of retrograde transcendence of sci-fi-ish high-tech for its own sake a transcendence of the vanity and the slavery to high-tech fashion that people view as so unattractive in one another. In other words a return to aural-only telephony became at the closed curve's end a kind of status-symbol of anti-vanity such that only callers utterly lacking in self-awareness continued to use videophony and Tableaux to say nothing of masks and these tacky facsimile-using people became ironic cultural symbols of tacky vain slavery to corporate PR and high-tech novelty became the Subsidized Era's tacky equivalents of people with leisure suits black velvet paintings sweater-vests for their poodles electric zirconium jewelry NoCoat Lin-guaScrapers and c. Most communications consumers put their Tableaux-dioramas at the back of a knick-knack shelf and covered their cameras with standard black lenscaps and now used their phone consoles' little mask-hooks to hang these new little plasticene address-and-phone diaries specially made with a little receptacle at the top of the binding for convenient hanging from former mask-hooks. Even then of course the bulk of U.S. consumers remained verifiably reluctant to leave home and teleputer and to interface personally though this phenomenon's endurance can't be attributed to the videophony-fad per se and anyway the new panagoraphobia served to open huge new entrepreneurial teleputerized markets for home-shopping and -delivery and didn't cause much industry concern. Four times per annum in these chemically troubled times the Organization of North American Nations Tennis Association's Juniors Division sends a young toxicologist with cornsilk hair and a smooth wide button of a nose and a blue O.N.A.N.T.A. blazer to collect urine samples from any student at any accredited tennis academy ranked higher than =tt=64 continen-tally in his or her age-division. Competitive junior tennis is meant to be good clean fun. It's October in the Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment. An impressive percentage of the kids at E.T.A. are in their divisions' top 64. On urine-sample day the juniors form two long lines that trail out of the locker rooms and up the stairs and then run agnate and coed across the E.T.A. Comm.-Ad. Bldg. lobby with its royal-blue shag and hardwood panelling and great glass cases of trophies and plaques. It takes about an hour to get from the middle of the line to your sex's locker room's stall-area where either the blond young toxicologist or on the girls' side a nurse whose severe widow's peak tops her square face with a sort of bisected forehead dispenses a plastic cup with a pale-green lid and a strip of white medical tape with a name and a monthly ranking and 10-15-Y.D.A.U. and Enf.T.A. neatly printed in a six-pt. font. Probably about a fourth of the ranking players over say fifteen at the Enfield Tennis Academy cannot pass a standard North American GC/MS5252 urine scan. These seventeen-year-old Michael Pemulis's nighttime customers now become also four times yearly his daytime customers. Clean urine is ten adjusted dollars a cc. 'Get your urine here!' Pemulis and Trevor Axford become quarterly urine vendors; they wear those papery oval caps ballparkvendors wear; they spend three months collecting and stashing the urine of sub-ten-year-old players warm pale innocent childish urine that's produced in needly little streams and the only G/M scan it couldn't pass would be like an Ovaltine scan or something; then every third month Pemulis and Axford work the agnate unsupervised line that snakes across the blue lobby shag selling little Visine bottles of urine out of an antique vendor's tub for ballpark wieners snagged for a song from a Fenway Park wienerman fallen on hard offseason times a big old box of dull dimpled tin with a strap in Sox colors that goes around the back of the neck and keeps the vendor's hands free to make change. 'Urine!’ 'Clinically sterile urine!’ 'Piping hot!’ 'Urine you'd be proud to take home and introduce to the folks!’ Trevor Axford handles cash-flow. Pemulis dispenses little conical-tipped Visine bottles of juvenile urine bottles easily rendered discreet in underarm sock or panty. 'Urine trouble? Urine luck!’ Quarterly sales breakdowns indicate slightly more male customers than female customers for urine. Tomorrow morning E.T.A. custodial workers — Kenkle and Brandt or Dave ('Fall Down Very') Harde the well-loved old janitor laid off from Boston College for contracting narcolepsy or thick-ankled Irish women from the semi-tenements down the hill across Comm. Ave. or else sullen and shifty-eyed residents from Ennet House the halfway facility at the bottom of the hill's other side in the old VA Hospital complex hard-looking and generally sullen types who come and do nine months of menial-type work for the 32 hours a week their treatment-contract requires — will empty scores of little empty plastic Visine bottles from subdorm wastebaskets into the dumpster-nest behind the E.T.A. Employee parking lot from which dumpsters Pemulis will then get Mario In-candenza and some of the naïver of the original ephebic urine-donators themselves to remove sterilize and rebox the bottles under the guise of a rousing game of Who-Can-Find-Boil-And-Box-The-Most-Empty-Visine-Bottles-In-A-Three- Hour-Period-Without-Any-KindOf-Authority-Figure-Knowing-What-You're-Up- To a game which Mario had found thumpingly weird when Pemulis introduced him to it three years ago but which Mario's really come to look forward to since he's found he has a real sort of mystical intuitive knack for finding Visine bottles in the sedimentary layers of packed dumpsters and always seems to win hands-down and if you're poor old Mario Incandenza you take your competitive strokes where you can find them. T. Axford then stashes and recycles the bottles and packaging overhead is nil. He and Pemulis keep the wiener-tub stashed under a discarded Yarmouth sail in the back of the used tow truck they'd chipped in on with Hal and Jim Struck and another guy who's since graduated E.T.A. and now plays for Pepperdine and paid to have reconditioned and the rusty chain and hook that hung from the tow truck's back-tilted derrick replaced with a gleamingly new chain and thick hook — which get used really only twice a year spring and late fall for brief intervals of short-distance hauling during the all-weather Lung's dismantling and erection plus occasionally pulling a paralyzed rear-wheel-drive student or employee vehicle either back onto or all the way up the E.T.A. hillside's long 70° driveway during bad snowstorms — and the whole thing derusted and painted in E.T.A.'s proud red and gray school colors with the complex O.N.A.N. heraldic ensign — a snarling full-front eagle with a broom and can of disinfectant in one claw and a Maple Leaf in the other and wearing a sombrero and appearing to have about half-eaten a swatch of star-studded cloth — rather ironically silk-screened onto the driver's-side door and the good old pre-Tavis E.T.A. traditional motto TE OCCIDERE POSSUNT. .. unironically emblazoned on the passenger door and which they all share use of though Pemulis and Axford get slight priority because the truck's registration and basic-liability insurance get paid for out of quarterly urine-revenues. Hal's older brother Mario — who by Dean of Students' fiat gets to bunk in a double with Hal in subdorm A on the third floor of Comm.-Ad. even though he's too physically challenged even to play low-level recreational tennis but who's keenly interested in video- and film-cartridge production and pulls his weight as part of the E.T.A. community recording assigned sections of matches and drills and processional stroke-filming sessions for later playback and analysis by Schtitt and his staff — is filming the congregated line and social interactions and vending operation of the urine-day lobby using his strap-attached head-mounted camera and thoracic police-lock and foot-treadle apparently getting footage for one of the short strange Himself-influenced conceptual cartridges the administration lets him occupy his time making and futzing around with down in the late founder's editing and f/x facilities off the main sub-Comm.-Ad. tunnel; and Pemulis and Axford do not object to the filming nor do they even do that hand-to-temple face-obscuring thing when he aims the head-mounted Bolex their way since they know nobody will end up seeing the footage except Mario himself and that at their request he'll modulate and scramble the vendors' and customers' faces into undulating systems of flesh-colored squares by means of his late father's reconfigururing matte-panel in the editing room since facial scrambling will heighten whatever weird conceptual effect Mario's usually after anyway though also because Mario's notoriously fond of undulating flesh-colored squares and will jump at any opportunity to edit them in over people's faces. They do brisk business. Michael Pemulis wiry pointy-featured phenomenally talented at net but about two steps too slow to get up there effectively against high-level pace — so in compensation also a great offensive-lob man — is a scholarship student from right nearby in Allston MA — a grim section of tract housing and vacant lots low-rise Greek and Irish housing projects gravel and haphazard sewage and indifferent municipal upkeep a lot of depressed petrochemical light industry all along the Spur an outlying district zoned for sprawl; an old joke in Enfield-Brighton goes ' "Kiss me where it smells" she said so I took her to Allston' — where he discovered a knack playing Boys Club tennis in cut-off shorts and no shirt and a store-strung stick on scuzzy courts with blacktop that discolored your yellow balls and nets made of spare Feeny Park fencing that sent net-cord shots spronging all the way out into traffic. An Inner City Development Program tennis prodigy at ten recruited up the hill at eleven with parents who wanted to know how much E.T.A.'d pay up front for rights to all future possible income. Cavalier about practice but a bundle of strangled nerves in tournaments the rap on Pemulis is that he's way lower-ranked than he could be with a little hard work since he's not only E.T.A.'s finest Eschatonic5353 marksman off the lob but Schtitt says is the one youth here now who knows truly what is it to punch the volley. Pemulis whose pre-E.T.A. home life was apparently hackle-raising also sells small-time drugs of distinguished potency at reasonable retail prices to a large pie-slice of the total junior-tournament-circuit market. Mario Incandenza is one of those people who wouldn't see the point of trying recreational chemicals even if he knew how to go about it. He just wouldn't get it. His smile below the Bolex camera strapped to his large but sort of withered-looking head is constant and broad as he films the line's serpentine movement against glass shelves full of prizes. M. M. Pemulis whose middle name is Mathew (sic) has the highest Stanford-Bïnet of any kid on academic probation ever at the Academy. Hal Incandenza's most valiant efforts barely get Pemulis through Mrs. I's triad of required Grammars5454 and Soma R.-L.-O. Chawaf's heady Literature of Discipline because Pemulis who claims he sees every third word upside-down actually just has a born tech-science wienie's congenital impatience with the referential murkiness and inelegance of verbal systems. His early tennis promise quick-peaking and it's turned out a bit dilettantish Pemulis's real enduring gift is for math and hard science and his scholarship is the coveted James O. Incandenza Geometrical Optics Scholarship of which there is only one and which each term Pemulis manages to avoid losing by just one dento-dermal layer of overall G.P.A. and which gives him sanctioned access to all the late director's lenses and equipment some of which turn out to be useful to unrelated enterprises. Mario's the only other person sharing the optic-and-editing labs off the main tunnel and the two have the kind of transpersonal bond that shared interests and mutual advantage can inspire: if Mario's not helping Pemulis fabricate the products of independentoptical-study work M.P. isn't really much into doing — you should see the boy with a convex lens Avril likes to say within Mario's hearing; he's like a fish in brine — then Pemulis is giving Mario who's a film-nut but no great tech-mind serious help with cinemo-optical praxis the physics of focal-length and reflective compounds — you should see Pemulis with an emulsion curve yawning blasély under his bill-reversed yachting hat and scratching an armpit juggling differentials like a boy born to wear a pocket-protector and high-water corduroys and electrician's tape on his hornrims' temples asking Mario if he knows what you call three Canadians copulating on a snowmobile. Mario and his brother Hal both consider Pemulis a good friend though friendship at E.T.A. is nonnego-tiable currency. Hal Incandenza for a long time identified himself as a lexical prodigy who — though Avril had taken pains to let all three of her children know that her nonjudgmental love and pride depended in no way on achievement or performance or potential talent — had made his mother proud plus a really good tennis player. Hal Incandenza is now being encouraged to identify himself as a late-blooming prodigy and possible genius at tennis who is on the verge of making every authority-figure in his world and beyond very proud indeed. He's never looked better on court or on monthly O.N.A.N.T.A. paper. He is erumpent. He has made what Schtitt termed a 'leap of exponents' at a post-pubescent age when radical plateaux-hopping near-J.-Wayne-and-Show-caliber improvement is extraordinarily rare in tennis. He gets his sterile urine gratis though he could well afford to pay: Pemulis depends on him for verbal-academic support and dislikes owing favors even to friends. Hal is at seventeen as of 10/Y.D.A.U. judged ex cathedra the fourth-best tennis player under age eighteen in the United States of America and the sixth-best on the continent by those athletic-organizing bodies duly charged with the task of ranking. Hal's head closely monitored by deLint and Staff is judged still level and focused and unswollen/-bludgeoned by the sudden eclat and rise in general expectations. When asked how he's doing with it all Hal says Fine and thanks you for asking. If Hal fulfills this newly emergent level of promise and makes it all the way up to the Show Mario will be the only one of the Incandenza children not wildly successful as a professional athlete. No one who knows Mario could imagine that this fact would ever even occur to him. Orin Mario and Hal's late father was revered as a genius in his original profession without anybody ever realizing what he really turned out to be a genius at even he himself at least not while he was alive which is perhaps bona-fidely tragic but also as far as Mario's concerned ultimately all right if that's the way things unfolded. Certain people find people like Mario Incandenza irritating or even think they're outright bats dead inside in some essential way. Michael Pemulis's basic posture with people is that Mrs. Pemulis raised no dewy-eyed fools. He wears painter's caps on-court and sometimes a yachting cap turned around 180° and since he's not ranked high enough to get any free-corporate-clothing offers plays in T-shirts with things like ALLSTON HS WOLF SPIDERS and CHOOSY MOTHERS and THE FIENDS IN HUMAN SHAPE Y.D.A.U. TOUR or like an ancient CAN YOU BELIEVE IT THE SUPREME COURT JUST DESECRATED OUR FLAG on them. His face is the sort of spiky-featured brow-dominated Feen-ian face you see all over Irish Allston and Brighton its chin and nose sharp and skin the natal brown color of the shell of a quality nut. Michael Pemulis is nobody's fool and he fears the dealer's Brutus the potential eater of cheese the rat the wiretap the pubescent-looking Finest sent to make him look foolish. So when somebody calls his room's phone even on video and wants to buy some sort of substance they have to right off the bat utter the words 'Please commit a crime' and Michael Pemulis will reply 'Gracious me and mine a crime you say?' and the customer has to insist right over the phone and say he'll pay Michael Pemulis money to commit a crime or like that he'll harm Michael Pemulis in some way if he refuses to commit a crime and Michael Pemulis will in a clear and I.D.able voice make an appointment to see the caller in person to 'plead for my honor and personal safety' so that if anybody eats cheese later or the phone's frequency is covertly accessed somehow Pemulis will have been entrapped.5555 Secreting a small Visine bottle of urine in an armpit in line also brings it up to plausible temperature. At the entrance to the male stall-area the ephebic-looking O.N.A.N.T.A. toxicologist rarely even looks up from his clipboard but the square-faced nurse can be a problem over on the female side because every so often she'll want the stall door open during production. With Jim Struck handling published-source plagiarism and compressed iteration and Xerography Pemulis also offers at reasonable cost a small vade mecumish pamphlet detailing several methods for dealing with this contingency. WINTER B.S. 1960 — TUCSON AZ Jim not that way Jim. That's no way to treat a garage door bending stiffly down at the waist and yanking at the handle so the door jerks up and out jerky and hard and you crack your shins and my ruined knees son. Let's see you bend at the healthy knees. Let's see you hook a soft hand lightly over the handle feeling its subtle grain and pull just as exactly gently as will make it come to you. Experiment Jim. See just how much force you need to start the door easy let it roll up out open on its hidden greasy rollers and pulleys in the ceiling's set of spiderwebbed beams. Think of all garage doors as the well-oiled open-out door of a broiler with hot meat in heat roiling out hot. Needless and dangerous ever to yank pull shove thrust. Your mother is a shover and a thruster son. She treats bodies outside herself without respect or due care. She's never learned that treating things in the gentlest most relaxed way is also treating them and your own body in the most efficient way. It's Marlon Brando's fault Jim. Your mother back in California before you were born before she became a devoted mother and long-suffering wife and breadwinner son your mother had a bit part in a Marlon Brando movie. Her big moment. Had to stand there in saddle shoes and bobby sox and ponytail and put her hands over her ears as really loud motorbikes roared by. A major thespian moment believe you me. She was in love from afar with this fellow Marlon Brando son. Who? Who. Jim Marlon Brando was the archetypal new-type actor who ruined it looks like two whole generations' relations with their own bodies and the everyday objects and bodies around them. No? Well it was because of Brando you were opening that garage door like that Jimbo. The disrespect gets learned and passed on. Passed down. You'll know Brando when you watch him and you'll have learned to fear him. Brando Jim Jesus B-r-a-n-d-o. Brando the new archetypal tough-guy rebel and slob type leaning back on his chair's rear legs coming crooked through doorways slouching against everything in sight trying to dominate objects showing no artful respect or care yanking things toward him like a moody child and using them up and tossing them crudely aside so they miss the wastebasket and just lie there ill-used. With the overclumsy impetuous movements and postures of a moody infant. Your mother is of that new generation that moves against life's grain across its warp and baffles. She may have loved Marlon Brando Jim but she didn't understand him is what's ruined her for everyday arts like broilers and garage doors and even low-level public-park knock-around tennis. Ever see your mother with a broiler door? It's carnage Jim it's to cringe to see it and the poor dumb thing thinks it's tribute to this slouching slob-type she loved as he roared by. Jim she never intuited the gentle and cunning economy behind this man's quote harsh sloppy unstudied approach to objects. The way he'd oh so clearly practiced a chair's back-leg tilt over and over. The way he studied objects with a welder's eye for those strongest centered seams which when pressured by the swinishest slouch still support. She never . . . never sees that Marlon Brando felt himself as body so keenly he'd no need for manner. She never sees that in his quote careless way he actually really touched whatever he touched as if it were part of him. Of his own body. The world he only seemed to manhandle was for him sentient feeling. And no one . . . and she never understood that. Sour sodding grapes indeed. You can't envy someone who can be that way. Respect maybe. Maybe wistful respect at the very outside. She never saw that Brando was playing the equivalent of high-level quality tennis across sound stages all over both coasts Jim is what he was really doing. Jim he moved like a careless finger-ling one big muscle muscularly naïve but always notice a fingerling at the center of a clear current. That kind of animal grace. The bastard wasted no motion is what made it art this brutish no-care. His was a tennis player's dictum: touch things with consideration and they will be yours; you will own them; they will move or stay still or move for you; they will lie back and part their legs and yield up their innermost seams to you. Teach you all their tricks. He knew what the Beats know and what the great tennis player knows son: learn to do nothing with your whole head and body and everything will be done by what's around you. I know you don't understand. Yet. I know that goggle-eyed stare. I know what it means all too well son. It's no matter. You will. Jim I know what I know. I'm predicting it right here young sir Jim. You are going to be a great tennis player. I was near-great. You will be truly great. You will be the real thing. I know I haven't taught you to play yet I know this is your first time Jim Jesus relax I know. It doesn't affect my predictive sense. You will overshadow and obliterate me. Today you are starting and within a very few years I know all too well you will be able to beat me out there and on the day you first beat me I may well weep. It'll be out of a sort of selfless pride an obliterated father's terrible joy. I feel it Jim even here standing on hot gravel and looking: in your eyes I see the appreciation of angle a prescience re spin the way you already adjust your overlarge and apparently clumsy child's body in the chair so it's at the line of best force against dish spoon lens-grinding appliance a big book's stiff bend. You do it unconsciously. You have no idea. But I watch very closely. Don't ever think I don't son. You will be poetry in motion Jim size and posture and all. Don't let the posture-problem fool you about your true potential out there. Take it from me for a change. The trick will be transcending that overlarge head son. Learning to move just the way you already sit still. Living in your body. This is the communal garage son. And this is our door in the garage. I know you know. I know you've looked at it before many times. Now . . . now see it Jim. See it as body. The dull-colored handle the clockwise latch the bits of bug trapped when the paint was wet and now still protruding. The cracks from this merciless sunlight out here. Original color anyone's guess boyo. The concave inlaid squares how many bevelled at how many levels at the borders that pass for decoration. Count the squares maybe ... let's see you treat this door like a lady son. Twisting the latch clockwise with one hand that's right and.... I guess you'll have to pull harder Jim. Maybe even harder than that. Let me ... that's the way she wants doing Jim. Have a look. Jim this is where we keep this 1956 Mercury Montclair you know so well. This Montclair weighs 3900 pounds give or take. It has eight cylinders and a canted windshield and aerodynamic fins Jim and has a maximum flat-out road-speed of 95 m.p.h. per. I described the shade of the paint job of this Montclair to the dealer when I first saw it as bit-lip red. Jim it's a machine. It will do what it's made for and do it perfectly but only when stimulated by someone who's made it his business to know its tricks and seams as a body. The stimulator of this car must know the car Jim feel it be inside much more than just the . . . the compartment. It's an object Jim a body but don't let it fool you sitting here mute. It will respond. If given its due. With artful care. It's a body and will respond with a well-oiled purr once I get some decent oil in her and all Mercuryish at up to 95 big ones per for just that driver who treats its body like his own who feels the big steel body he's inside who quietly and unnoticed feels the nubbly plastic of the grip of the shift up next to the wheel when he shifts just as he feels the skin and flesh the muscle and sinew and bone wrapped in gray spiderwebs of nerves in the blood-fed hand just as he feels the plastic and metal and flange and teeth the pistons and rubber and rods of the amber-fueled Montclair when he shifts. The bodily red of a well-bit lip parping along at a silky 80-plus per. Jim a toast to our knowledge of bodies. To high-level tennis on the road of life. Ah. Oh. Son you're ten and this is hard news for somebody ten even if you're almost five-eleven a possible pituitary freak. Son you're a body son. That quick little scientific-prodigy's mind she's so proud of and won't quit twittering about: son it's just neural spasms those thoughts in your mind are just the sound of your head revving and head is still just body Jim. Commit this to memory. Head is body. Jim brace yourself against my shoulders here for this hard news at ten: you're a machine a body an object Jim no less than this rutilant Montclair this coil of hose here or that rake there for the front yard's gravel or sweet Jesus this nasty fat spider flexing in its web over there up next to the rake-handle see it? See it? Latrodectus mactans Jim. Widow. Grab this racquet and move gracefully and feelingly over there and kill that widow for me young sir Jim. Go on. Make it say 'K.' Take no names. There's a lad. Here's to a spiderless section of communal garage. Ah. Bodies bodies everywhere. A tennis ball is the ultimate body kid. We're coming to the crux of what I have to try to impart to you before we get out there and start actuating this fearsome potential of yours. Jim a tennis ball is the ultimate body. Perfectly round. Even distribution of mass. But empty inside utterly a vacuum. Susceptible to whim spin to force — used well or poorly. It will reflect your own character. Characterless itself. Pure potential. Have a look at a ball. Get a ball from the cheap green plastic laundry basket of old used balls I keep there by the propane torches and use to practice the occasional serve Jimbo. Attaboy. Now look at the ball. Heft it. Feel the weight. Here I'll... tear the ball. . . open. Whew. See? Nothing in there but evacuated air that smells like a kind of rubber hell. Empty. Pure potential. Notice I tore it open along the seam. It's a body. You'll learn to treat it with consideration son some might say a kind of love and it will open for you do your bidding be at your beck and soft lover's call. The thing truly great players with hale bodies who overshadow all others have is a way with the ball that's called and keep in mind the garage door and broiler touch. Touch the ball. Now that's ... that's the touch of a player right there. And as with the ball so with that big thin slumped overtall body sir Jimbo. I'm predicting it right now. I see the way you'll apply the lessons of today to yourself as a physical body. No more carrying your head at the level of your chest under round slumped shoulders. No more tripping up. No more overshot reaches shattered plates tilted lampshades slumped shoulders and caved-in chest the simplest objects twisting and resistant in your big thin hands boy. Imagine what it feels like to be this ball Jim. Total physicality. No revving head. Complete presence. Absolute potential sitting there potentially absolute in your big pale slender girlish hand so young its thumb's unwrinkled at the joint. My thumb's wrinkled at the joint Jim some might say gnarled. Have a look at this thumb right here. But I still treat it as my own. I give it its due. You want a drink of this son? I think you're ready for a drink of this. No? Nein? Today Lesson One out there you become for better or worse Jim a man. A player. A body in commerce with bodies. A helmsman at your own vessel's tiller. A machine in the ghost to quote a phrase. Ah. A ten-year-old freakishly tall bowtied and thick-spectacled citizen of the. ... I drink this sometimes when I'm not actively working to help me accept the same painful things it's now time for me to tell you son. Jim. Are you ready? I'm telling you this now because you have to know what I'm about to tell you if you're going to be the more than near-great top-level tennis player I know you're going to be eventually very soon. Brace yourself. Son get ready. It's glo . . . gloriously painful. Have just maybe a taste here. This flask is silver. Treat it with due care. Feel its shape. The near-soft feel of the warm silver and the calfskin sheath that covers only half its flat rounded silver length. An object that rewards a considered touch. Feel the slippery heat? That's the oil from my fingers. My oil Jim from my body. Not my hand son feel the flask. Heft it. Get to know it. It's an object. A vessel. It's a two-pint flask full of amber liquid. Actually more like half full it seems. So it seems. This flask has been treated with due care. It's never been dropped or jostled or crammed. It's never had an errant drop not drop one spilled out of it. I treat it as if it can feel. I give it its due as a body. Unscrew the cap. Hold the calfskin sheath in your right hand and use your good left hand to feel the cap's shape and ease it around on the threads. Son . . . son you'll have to put that what is that that Columbia Guide to Refractive Indices Second Edition down son. Looks heavy anyway. A tendon-strainer. Fuck up your pronator teres and surrounding tendons before you even start. You're going to have to put down the book for once young Sir Jimbo you never try to handle two objects at the same time without just aeons of diligent practice and care a Brando-like dis . . . and well no you don't just drop the book son you don't just just don't drop the big old Guide to Indices on the dusty garage floor so it raises a square bloom of dust and gets our nice white athletic socks all gray before we even hit the court boy Jesus I just took five minutes explaining how the key to being even a potential player is to treat the things with just exactly the ... here lemme have this .. . that books aren't just dropped with a crash like bottles in the trashcan they're placed guided with senses on Full feeling the edges the pressure on the little floor of both hands' fingers as you bend at the knees with the book the slight gassy shove as the air on the dusty floor ... as the floor's air gets displaced in a soft square that raises no dust. Like soooo. Not like so. Got me? Got it? Well now don't be that way. Son don't be that way now. Don't get all oversensitive on me son when all I'm trying to do is help you. Son Jim I hate this when you do this. Your chin just disappears into that bow-tie when your big old overhung lower lip quivers like that. You look chinless son and big-lipped. And that cape of mucus that's coming down on your upper lip the way it shines don't just don't it's revolting son you don't want to revolt people you have to learn to control this sort of oversensitivity to hard truths this sort of thing take and exert some goddamn control is the whole point of what I'm taking this whole entire morning off rehearsal with not one but two vitally urgent auditions looming down my neck so I can show you planning to let you move the seat back and touch the shift and maybe even ... maybe even drive the Montclair God knows your feet'll reach right Jimbo? Jim hey why not drive the Montclair? Why not you drive us over starting today pull up by the courts where today you'll — here look see how I unscrew it? the cap? with the soft very outermost tips of my gnarled fingers which I wish they were steadier but I'm exerting control to control my anger at that chin and lip and the cape of snot and the way your eyes slant and goggle like some sort of mon-goloid child's when you're threatening to cry but just the very tips of the fingers here the most sensitive parts the parts bathed in warm oil the whorled pads I feel them singing with nerves and blood I let them extend ... further than the warm silver hip-flask's cap's very top down its broadening cone where to where the threads around the upraised little circular mouth lie hidden while with the other warm singing hand I gently grip the leather holster so I can feel the way the whole flask feels as I guide ... guide the cap around on its silver threads hear that? stop that and listen hear that? the sound of threads moving through well-machined grooves with great care a smooth barbershop spiral my whole hand right through the pads of my fingertips less ... less unscrewing here than guiding persuading reminding the silver cap's body what it's built to do machined to do the silver cap knows Jim I know you know we've been through this before leave the book alone boy it's not going anywhere so the silver cap leaves the flask's mouth's warm grooved lips with just a snick hear that? that faintest snick? not a rasp or a grinding sound or harsh not a harsh brutal Brando-esque rasp of attempted domination but a snick a ... nuance there ah oh like the once you've heard it never mistakable ponk of a true-hit ball Jim well pick it up then if you're afraid of a little dust Jim pick the book up if it's going to make you all goggle-eyed and chinless honestly Jesus why do I try I try and try just wanted to introduce you to the broiler's garage and let you drive maybe feeling the Montclair's body taking my time to let you pull up to the courts with the Montclair's shift in a neutral glide and the eight cylinders thrumming and snicking like a healthy heart and the wheels all perfectly flush with the curb and bring out my good old trusty laundry . .. laundry basket of balls and racquets and towels and flask and my son my flesh of my flesh white slumped flesh of my flesh who wanted to embark on what I predict right now will be a tennis career that'll put his busted-up used-up old Dad back square in his little place who wanted to maybe for once be a real boy and learn how to play and have fun and frolic and play around in the unrelieved sunshine this city's so fuck-all famous for to enjoy it while he can because did your mother tell you we're moving? That we're moving back to California finally this spring? We're moving son I'm harking one last attempted time to that celluloid siren's call I'm giving it the one last total shot a man's obligation to his last waning talent deserves Jim we're headed for the big time again at last for the first time since she announced she was having you Jim hitting the road celluloid-bound so say adios to that school and that fluttery little moth of a physics teacher and those slumped chinless slide-rule-wielding friends of no now wait I didn't mean it I meant I wanted to tell you now ahead of time your mother and I to give you plenty of notice so you could adjust this time because oh you made it so unmisinterpretably clear how this last move to this trailer park upset you so didn't you to a mobile home with chemical toilet and bolts to hold it in place and widow-webs everyplace you look and grit settling on everything like dust out here instead of the Club's staff quarters I got us removed from or the house it was clearly my fault we couldn't afford anymore. It was my fault. I mean who else's fault would it be? Am I right? That we moved your big soft body with allegedly not enough notice and that east-side school you cried over and that Negro research resource librarian there with the hair out to here that. . . that lady with the upturned nose on tiptoe all the time I have to tell you she seemed so consummate east-side Tucsonian all self-consciously not of this earth's grit urging us to quote nurture your optical knack with physics with her nose upturned so you could see up in there and on her toes like something skilled overhead had sunk a hook between her big splayed fingerling's nostrils and were reeling skyward up toward the aether little by little I'll bet those heelless pumps are off the floor altogether by now son what do you say son what do you think . . . no go on cry don't inhibit yourself I won't say a word except it's getting to me less all the time when you do it I'll just warn you I think you're overworking the tears and the . . . it's getting less effec .. . effective with me each time you use it though we know we both know don't we just between you and me we know it'll always work on your mother won't it never fail she'll every time take and bend your big head down to her shoulder so it looks obscene if you could see it pat-patting on your back like she's burping some sort of slumping oversized obscene bow-tied infant with a book straining his pronator teres crying will you do this when you're grown? Will there be episodes like this when you're a man at your own tiller? A citizen of a world that won't go pat-pat-there-there? Will your face crumple and bulge like this when you're six-and-a-half grotesque feet tall six-six-plus like your grandfather may he rot in hell's rubber vacuum when he finally kicks on the tenth tee and with your flat face and no chin just like him on that poor dumb patient woman's fragile wet snotty long-suffering shoulder did I tell you what he did? Did I tell you what he did? I was your age Jim here take the flask no give it here oh. Oh. I was thirteen and I'd started to play well seriously I was twelve or thirteen and playing for years already and he'd never been to watch he'd never come once to where I was playing to watch or even changed his big flat expression even once when I brought home a trophy I won trophies or a notice in the paper TUCSON NATIVE QUALIFIES FOR NATIONAL JR CH'SHIPS he never acknowledged I even existed as I was not as I do you Jim not as I take care to bend over backwards way way out of my way to let you know I see you recognize you am aware of you as a body care about what might go on behind that big flat face bent over a homemade prism. He plays golf. Your grandfather. Your grand-pappy. Golf. A golf man. Is my tone communicating the contempt? Billiards on a big table Jim. A bodiless game of spasmodic flailing and flying sod. A quote unquote sport. Anal rage and checkered berets. This is almost empty. This is just about it son. What say we rain-check this. What say I put the last of this out of its amber misery and we go in and tell her you're not feeling up to snuff enough again and we're rain-checking your first introduction to the Game till this weekend and we'll head over this weekend and do two straight days both days and give you a really extensive intensive intro to a by all appearances limitless future. Intensive gentleness and bodily care equals great tennis Jim. We'll go both days and let you plunge right in and get wet all over. It's only five dollars. The court fee. For one lousy hour. Each day. Five dollars each day. Don't give it a thought. Ten total dollars for an intensive weekend when we live in a glorified trailer and have to share a garage with two DeSotos and what looks like a Model A on blocks and my Montclair can't afford the kind of oil she deserves. Don't look like that. What's money or my rehearsals for the celluloid auditions we're moving 700 miles for auditions that may well comprise your old man's last shot at a life with any meaning at all compared to my son? Right? Am I right? Come here kid. C'mere c'mere c'mere c'mere. That's a boy. That's my J.O.I of a guy of a joy of boy. That's my kid in his body. He never came once Jim. Not once. To watch. Mother never missed a competitive match of course. Mother came to so many it ceased to mean anything that she came. She became part of the environment. Mothers are like that as I'm sure you're aware all too well am I right? Right? Never came once kiddo. Never lumbered over all slumped and soft and cast his big grotesque long-even-at-midday shadow at any court I performed on. Till one day he came once. Suddenly once without precedent or warning he ... came. Ah. Oh. I heard him coming long before he hove into view. He cast a long shadow Jim. It was some minor local event. It was some early-round local thing of very little consequence in the larger scheme. I was playing some local dandy the kind with fine equipment and creased white clothing and country-club lessons that still can't truly play even regardless of all the support. You'll find you often have to endure this type of opponent in the first couple rounds. This gleaming hapless lox of a kid was some client of my father's son .. . son of one of his clients. So he came for the client to put on some sham show of fatherly concern. He wore a hat and coat and tie at 95° plus. The client. Can't recall the name. There was something canine about his face I remember that his kid across the net had inherited. My father wasn't even sweating. I grew up with the man in this town and never once saw him sweat Jim. I remember he wore a boater and the sort of gregariously plaid uniform professional men had to wear on the weekends then. They sat in the indecisive shade of a scraggly palm the sort of palm that's just crawling with black widows in the fronds that come down without warning that hide lying in wait in the heat of midday. They sat on the blanket my mother always brought — my mother who's dead and the client. My father stood apart sometimes in the waving shade sometimes not smoking a long filter. Long filters had come into fashion. He never sat on the ground. Not in the American Southwest he didn't. There was a man with a healthy respect for spiders. And never on the ground under a palm. He knew he was too grotesquely tall and ungainly to stand up in a hurry or roll screaming out of the way in a hurry in case of falling spiders. They've been known to be willing to drop right out of the trees they hide in in the daytime you know. Drop right on you if you're sitting on the ground in the shade. He was no fool the bastard. A golfer. They all watched. I was right there on the first court. This park no longer exists Jim. Cars are now parked on what used to be these rough green asphalt courts shimmering in the heat. They were right there watching their heads going back and forth in that windshield-wiper way of people watching quality tennis. And was I nervous young sir J.O.I.? With the one and only Himself there in all his wooden glory there watching half in and out of the light expressionless? I was not. I was in my body. My body and I were one. My wood Wilson from my stack of wood Wilsons in their trapezoid presses was a sentient expression of my arm and I felt it singing and my hand and they were alive my well-armed hand was the secretary of my mind lithe and responsive and senza errori because I knew myself as a body and was fully inside my little child's body out there Jim I was in my big right arm and scarless legs safely ensconced running here and there my head pounding like a heart sweat purled on every limb running like a veldt-creature leaping frolicking striking with maximum economy and minimum effort my eyes on the ball and the corners both I was two three a couple shots ahead of both me and the hapless canine client's kid handing the dandy his pampered ass. It was carnage. It was a scene out of nature in its rawest state Jim. You should have been there. The kid kept bending over to get his breath. The smoothly economical frolicking I was doing contrasted starkly compared to the heavily jerky way he was being forced to stomp around and lunge. His white knit shirt and name-brand shorts were soaked through so you could see the straps of his jock biting into the soft ass I was handing him. He wore a flitty little white visor such as fifty-two-year-old women at country clubs and posh Southwestern resorts wear. I was in a word deft considered prescient. I made him stomp and stagger and lunge. I wanted to humiliate him. The client's long sharp face was sagging. My father had no face it was sharply shadowed and then illuminated in the wagging fronds' shadow he half stood in but was wreathed in smoke from the long filters he fancied long plastic filtered holders yellowed at the stem in imitation of the President as courtiers once spluttered with the King . . . veiled in shade and then lit smoke. The client didn't know enough to keep quiet. He thought he was at a ball game or something. The client's voice carried. Our first court was right near the tree they sat under. The client's legs were out in front of them and protruded from the sharp star of frond-shade. His slacks were lattice-shadowed from the pattern of the fence his son and I played just behind. He was drinking the lemonade my mother had brought for me. She made it fresh. He said I was good. My father's client did. In that emphasized way that made his voice carry. You know son? Good godfrey Incandenza old trout but that lad of yours is good. Unquote. I heard him say it as I ran and whacked and frolicked. And I heard the tall son of a bitch's reply after a long pause during which the world's whole air hung there as if lifted and left to swing. Standing at the baseline or walking back to the baseline to either serve or receive one of the two I heard the client. His voice carried. And then later I heard my father's reply may he rot in a green and empty hell. I heard what. .. what he said in reply sonbo. But not until after I'd fallen. I insist on this point Jim. Not until after I'd started to fall. Jim I'd been in the middle of trying to run down a ball way out of mortal reach a rare blind lucky dribbler of a drop-shot from the over-groomed lox across the net. A point I could have more than afforded to concede. But that's not the way I ... that's not the way a real player plays. With respect and due effort and care for every point. You want to be great near-great you give every ball everything. And then some. You concede nothing. Even against loxes. You play right up to your limit and then pass your limit and look back at your former limit and wave a hankie at it embarking. You enter a trance. You feel the seams and edges of everything. The court becomes a ... an extremely unique place to be. It will do everything for you. It will let nothing escape your body. Objects move as they're made to at the lightest easiest touch. You slip into the clear current of back and forth making delicate X's and L's across the harsh rough bright green asphalt surface your sweat the same temperature as your skin playing with such ease and total mindless effortless effort and and and entranced concentration you don't even stop to consider whether to run down every ball. You're barely aware you're doing it. Your body's doing it for you and the court and Game's doing it for your body. You're barely involved. It's magic boy. Nothing touches it when it's right. I predict it. Facts and figures and curved glass and those elbow-straining books of yours' lightless pages are going to seem flat by comparison. Static. Dead and white and flat. They don't begin to. ... It's like a dance Jim. The point is I was too bodily respectful to slip up and fall on my own out there. And the other point is I started to fall forward even before I started to hear him reply standing there: Yes But He'll Never Be Great. What he said in no way made me fall forward. The unlovely opponent had dribbled one just barely over the too-low public-park net a freak accident a mishit drop-shot and another man on another court in another early-round laugher would have let it dribble conceded the affordable not tried to wave a hankie from the vessel of his limit. Not race on all eight healthy scarless cylinders desperately forward toward the net to try to catch the goddamn thing on the first bounce. Jim but any man can slip. I don't know what I slipped on son. There were spiders well-known to infest the palms' fronds all along the courts' fences. They come down at night on threads bulbous flexing. I'm thinking it could have been a bulbous goo-filled widow I stepped and slipped on Jim a spider a mad rogue spider come down on its thread into the shade flabby and crawling or that leapt suicidally right from an overhanging frond onto the court probably making a slight flabby hideous sound when it landed crawling around on its claws blinking grotesquely in the hot light it hated that I stepped on rushing forward and killed and slipped on the mess the big loathsome spider made. See these scars? All knotted and ragged like something had torn at my own body's knees the way a slouching Brando would just rip a letter open with his teeth and let the envelope fall on the floor all wet and rent and torn? All the palms along the fence were sick they had palm-rot it was the A.D. year 1933 of the Great Bisbee Palm-Rot epidemic all through the state and they were losing their fronds and the fronds were blighted and the color of really old olives in those old slim jars at the very back of the refrigerator and exuded a sick sort of puslike slippery discharge and sometimes abruptly fell from trees curving back and forth through the air like celluloid pirates' paper swords. God I hate fronds Jim. I'm thinking it could have been either a daytime latrodectus or some pus from a frond. The wind blew cruddy pus from the webbed fronds onto the court maybe up near the net. Either way. Something poisonous or infected at any rate unexpected and slick. All it takes is a second you're thinking Jim: the body betrays you and down you go on your knees sliding on sandpaper court. Not so son. I used to have another flask like this smaller a rather more cunning silver flask in the glove compartment of my Montclair. Your devoted mother did something to it. The subject has never been mentioned between us. Not so. It was a foreign body or a substance not my body and if anybody did any betraying that day I'm telling you sonny kid boy it was something / did Jimmer I may well have betrayed that fine young lithe tan unslumped body I may very well have gotten rigid overconscious careless of it listening for what my father who I respected I respected that man Jim is what's sick I knew he was there I was conscious of his flat face and filter's long shadow I knew him Jim. Things were different when I was growing up Jim. I hate ... Jesus I hate saying something like this this things-were-different-when-I-was-a-lad-type cliche shit the sort of cliche fathers back then spouted assuming he said anything at all. But it was. Different. Our kids my generation's kids they ... now you this post-Brando crowd you new kids can't like us or dislike us or respect us or not as human beings Jim. Your parents. No wait you don't have to pretend you disagree don't you don't have to say it Jim. Because I know it. I could have predicted it watching Brando and Dean and the rest and I know it so don't splutter. I blame no one your age boyo. You see parents as kind or unkind or happy or miserable or drunk or sober or great or near-great or failed the way you see a table square or a Montclair lip-red. Kids today . . . you kids today somehow don't know how to feel much less love to say nothing of respect. We're just bodies to you. We're just bodies and shoulders and scarred knees and big bellies and empty wallets and flasks to you. I'm not saying something cliche like you take us for granted so much as I'm saying you cannot. .. imagine our absence. We're so present it's ceased to mean. We're environmental. Furniture of the world. Jim I could imagine that man's absence. Jim I'm telling you you cannot imagine my absence. It's my fault Jim home so much limping around ruined knees overweight under the Influence burping nonslim sweat-soaked in that broiler of a trailer burping farting frustrated miserable knocking lamps over overshooting my reach. Afraid to give my last talent the one shot it demanded. Talent is its own expectation Jim: you either live up to it or it waves a hankie receding forever. Use it or lose it he'd say over the newspaper. I'm ... I'm just afraid of having a tombstone that says HERE LIES A PROMISING OLD MAN. It's ... potential may be worse than none Jim. Than no talent to fritter in the first place lying around guzzling because I haven't the balls to ... God I'm I'm so sorry. Jim. You don't deserve to see me like this. I'm so scared Jim. I'm so scared of dying without ever being really seen. Can you understand? Are you enough of a big thin prematurely stooped young bespectacled man even with your whole life still ahead of you to understand? Can you see I was giving it all I had? That I was in there out there in the heat listening webbed with nerves? A self that touches all edges I remember she said. I felt it in a way I fear you and your generation never could son. It was less like falling than being shot out of something is the way I recall it. It did not did not happen in slow motion. One minute I was at a dead and beautiful forward run for the ball the next minute there were hands at my back and nothing underfoot like a push down a stairway. A rude whip-lashing shove square in the back and my promising body with all its webs of nerves pulsing and firing was in full airborne flight and came down on my knees this flask is empty right down on my knees with all my weight and inertia on that scabrous hot sandpaper surface forced into what was an exact parody of an imitation of contemplative prayer sliding forward. The flesh and then tissue and bone left twin tracks of brown red gray white like tire tracks of bodily gore extending from the service line to the net. I slid on my flaming knees rushed past the dribbling ball and toward the net that ended my slide. Our slide. My racquet had gone pinwheeling off Jim and my racquetless arms out before me sliding Jim in the attitude of a mortified monk in total prayer. It was given me to hear my father pronounce my bodily existence as not even potentially great at the moment I ruined my knees forever Jim so that even years later at USC I never got to wave my hankie at anything beyond the near- and almost-great and would-havebeen-great-// and later could never even hope to audition for those swim-trunk and Brylcreem beach movies that snake Avalon is making his mint on. I do not insist that the judgment and punishing fall are ... were connected Jim. Any man can slip out there. All it takes is a second of misplaced respect. Son it was more than a father's voice carrying. My mother cried out. It was a religious moment. I learned what it means to be a body Jim just meat wrapped in a sort of flimsy nylon stocking son as I fell kneeling and slid toward the stretched net myself seen by me frame by frame torn open. I may have to burp belch son son telling you what I learned son my .. . my love too late as I left my knees' meat behind me slid ended in a posture of supplication on my knees' disclosed bones with my fingers racquetless hooked through the mesh of the net across which the net the sopped dandy had dropped his pricey gut-strung Davis racquet and was running toward me with his visor askew and his hands to his cheeks. My father and the client he was there to perform for dragged me upright to the palm's infected shade where she knelt on the plaid beach-blanket with her knuckles between her teeth Jim and I felt the religion of the physical that day at not much more than your age Jim shoes filling with blood held under the arms by two bodies big as yours and dragged off a public court with two extra lines. It's a pivotal it's a seminal religious day when you get to both hear and feel your destiny at the same moment Jim. I got to notice what I'm sure you've noticed long ago I know I know you've seen me brought home on occasions dragged in the door under what's called the Influence son helped in by cabbies at night I've seen your long shadow grotesquely backlit at the top of the house's stairs I helped pay for boy: how the drunk and the maimed both are dragged forward out of the arena like a boneless Christ one man under each arm feet dragging eyes on the aether. 4 NOVEMBER YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT From Cambridge's Latinate Inman Square Michael Pemulis nobody's fool at all rides one necessary bus to Central Square and then an unnecessary bus to Davis Square and a train back to Central. This is to throw off the slightest possible chance of pursuit. At Central he catches the Red Line to Park St. Station where he's parked the tow truck in an underground lot he can more than afford. The day is autumnal and mild the east breeze smelling of urban commerce and the vague suede smell of new-fallen leaves. The sky is pilot-light blue; sunlight reflects complexly off the smoked-glass sides of tall centers of commerce all around Park St. downtown. Pemulis wears button-fly chinos and an E.T.A. shirt beneath a snazzy blue Brioni sport-coat plus the brightwhite yachting cap that Mario Incandenza calls his Mr. Howell hat. The hat looks rakish even when turned around and it has a detachable lining. Inside the lining can be kept portable quantities of just about anything. Having indulged in 150 nig. of very mild 'drines post-transaction. Wearing also gray-and-blue saddle oxfords w/o socks it's such a mild autumn day. The streets literally bustle. Vendors with carts instead of tubs sell hot pretzels and tonics and those underboiled franks Pemulis likes to have them put the works on. You can see the State House and Common and Courthouse and Public Gardens and beyond all that the cool smooth facades of Back Bay brownstones. The echoes in the underground Park PL garage — PARK — are pleasantly complex. Traffic westward on Commonwealth Avenue is light (meaning things can move) all the way through Ken-more Square and past Boston U. and up the long slow hill into Allston and Enfield. When Tavis and Schtitt and the players and ground crew and Testar and ATHSCME teams inflate the all-weather Lung for the winter over Courts 16-32 the domed Lung's nacelle is visible against the horizon all the way down by the Brighton Ave.-Comm. Ave. split in lower Allston. The incredibly potent DMZ is apparently classed as a para-methoxylated amphetamine but really it looks to Pemulis from his slow and tortured survey of the MED.COM's monographs more like more similar to the anticholinergic-deliriant class Way more powerful than mescaline or MDA or DMA or TMA or MDMA or DOM or STP or the I.V.-ingestible DMT (or Ololiuqui or datura's scopolamine or Fluothane or Bufotenine (a.k.a. 'Jackie-O.') or Ebene or psilocybin or Cylert5656; DMZ resembling chemically some miscegenation of a lysergic with a muscimoloid but significantly different from LSD-25 in that its effects are less visual and spatially-cerebral and more like temporally-cerebral and almost ontological with some sort of manipulatedphenylkylamine-like speediness whereby the ingester perceives his relation to the ordinary flow of time as radically (and euphorically is where the muscimole-affective resemblance shows its head) altered.5757 The incredibly potent DMZ is synthesized from a derivative of fitviavi an obscure mold that grows only on other molds by the same ambivalently lucky chemist at Sandoz Pharm. who'd first stumbled on LSD as a relatively ephebic and clueless organic chemist while futzing around with ergotic fungi on rye. DMZ's discovery was the tail-end of the B.S. 1960s just about the same time Dr. Alan Watts was considering T. Leary's invitation to become 'Writer in Resonance' at Leary's Utopian LSD-25 colony in Millbrook NY on what is now Canadian soil. A substance even just the accidental-synthesis of which sent the Sandoz chemist into early retirement and serious unblinking wall-watching the incredibly potent DMZ has a popular-lay-chemical-underground reputation as the single grimmest thing ever conceived in a tube. It is also now the hardest recreational compound to acquire in North America after raw Vietnamese opium which forget it. DMZ is sometimes also referred to in some metro Boston chemical circles as Madame Psychosis after a popular very-earlymorning cult radio personality on M.I.T.'s student-run radio station WYYY-109 'Largest Whole Prime on the FM Band' which Mario Incandenza and E.T.A. stats-wienie and Eschaton game-master Otis P. Lord listen to almost religiously. The day-shift Ennet House kid at the booth who raises the portcullis to let him onto the grounds had a couple times in October approached Pemulis about a potential transaction. Pemulis has a rigid policy about not transacting with E.T.A. employees who come up the hill from the halfway house since he knows some of them are at the place on Court Order and knows for a fact they pull unscheduled Urines all over the place down there and types like the Ennet House types are just the sorts of people Pemulis's talents let him get away from in terms of like social milieu and mixing and transacting; and his basic attitude with these low-rent employees is one of unfoolish discretion and like why tempt fate. The East Courts are empty and ball-strewn when Pemulis pulls in; most of them are still at lunch. Pemulis Troeltsch and Schacht's triple-room is in subdorm B in the back north part of the second floor of West House and so superjacent to the Dining Hall from which through the floor Pemulis can hear voices and silverware and can smell exactly what they're having. The first thing he does is boot up the phone console and try Inc and Mario's room over in Comm.-Ad. where Hal is sitting in wíndowlight with the Riverside Hamlet he told Mario he'd read and help with a conceptual film-type project based on part of his uncushioned captain's chair partly under an old print of a detail from the minor and soft-core Alexandrian mosaic Consummation of the Levirates eating an AminoPal® energy-bar and waiting very casually the phone with its antenna already out lying ready on the arm of the chair and two folio-size Baron's SAT-prep guides and a spine-shot copy of the B.S. 1937 Tilden on Spin and his keys on their neck-chain lying on the Lindistarne carpet by his shoe waiting in a very casual posture. Hal deliberately waits till the audio console's third ring like a girl at home on Saturday night. 'Mmyellow.’ 'The turd emergeth.' Pemulis's clear and digitally condensed voice on the line. 'Repeat. The turd emergeth.’ 'Please commit a crime' is Hal Incandenza's immediate reply. 'Gracious me' Pemulis says into the phone tucked under his jaw carefully de-Velcroing the lining of his Mr. Howell hat. TENNIS AND THE FERAL PRODIGY NARRATED BY HAL INCANDENZA AN 11.5-MINUTE DIGITAL ENTERTAINMENT CARTRIDGE DIRECTED RECORDED EDITED AND — ACCORDING TO THE ENTRY FORM — WRITTEN BY MARIO INCANDENZA IN RECEIPT OF NEW-NEW-ENGLAND REGIONAL HONORABLE MENTION IN INTERLACE TELENTERTAINMENT'S ANNUAL 'NEW EYES NEW VOICES' YOUNG FILMMAKERS’ CONTEST APRIL IN THE YEAR OF THE YUSHITYU 2007 MIMETIC-RESOLUTION-CARTRIDGE-VIEW-MOTHERBOARDEASY-TO-INSTALL UPGRADE FOR INFERNATRON/INTERLACE TP SYSTEMS FOR HOME OFFICE OR MOBILE (SIC) ALMOST EXACTLY THREE YEARS AFTER DR. JAMES O. INCANDENZA PASSED FROM THIS LIFE Here is how to put on a big red tent of a shirt that has ETA across the chest in gray. Please ease carefully into your supporter and adjust the elastic straps so the straps do not bite into your butt and make bulged ridges in your butt that everyone can see once you've sweated through your shorts. Here is how to wrap your torn ankle so tightly in its flesh-tone Ace bandages your left leg feels like a log. Here is how to win later. This is a yellow iron-mesh Ball-Hopper full of dirty green dead old balls. Take them to the East Courts while the dawn is still chalky and no one's around except the mourning doves that infest the pines at sunrise and the air is so sopped you can see your summer breath. Hit serves to no one. Make a mess of balls along the base of the opposite fence as the sun hauls itself up over the Harbor and a thin sweat breaks and the serves start to boom. Stop thinking and let it flow and go boom boom. The shiver of the ball against the opposite fence. Hit about a thousand serves to no one while Himself sits and advises with his flask. Older men's legs are white and hairless from decades in pants. Here is the set of keys a stride's length before you in the court as you serve dead balls to no one. After each serve you must almost fall forward into the court and in one smooth motion bend and scoop up the keys with your left hand. This is how to train yourself to follow through into the court after the serve. You still years after the man's death cannot keep your keys anywhere but on the floor. This is how to hold the stick. Learn to call the racquet a stick. Everyone does here. It's a tradition: The Stick. Something so much an extension of you deserves a sobriquet. Please look. You'll be shown exactly once how to hold it. This is how to hold it. Just like this. Forget all the near-Easternslice-backhand-grip bafflegab. Just say Hello is all. Just shake hands with the calfskin grip of the stick. This is how to hold it. The stick is your friend. You will become very close. Grasp your friend firmly at all times. A firm grip is essential for both control and power. Here is how to carry a tennis ball around in your stick-hand squeezing it over and over for long stretches of time — in class on the phone in lab in front of the TP a wet ball for the shower ideally squeezing it at all times except during meals. See the Academy dining hall where tennis balls sit beside every plate. Squeeze the tennis ball rhythmically month after year until you feel it no more than your heart squeezing blood and your right forearm is three times the size of your left and your arm looks from across a court like a gorilla's arm or a stevedore's arm pasted on the body of a child. Here is how to do extra individual drills before the Academy's A.M. drills before breakfast so that after the thousandth ball hit just out of reach by Himself with his mammoth wingspan and ghastly calves urging you with nothing but smiles on to great and greater demonstrations of effort so that after you've gotten your third and final wind and must vomit there is little inside to vomit and the spasms pass quickly and an east breeze blows cooler past you and you feel clean and can breathe. Here is how to don red and gray E.T.A. sweats and squad-jog a weekly 40 km. up and down urban Commonwealth Avenue even though you would rather set your hair on fire than jog in a pack. Jogging is painful and pointless but you are not in charge. Your brother gets to ride shotgun while a senile German blows BBs at your legs both of them laughing and screaming Schnell. Enfield is due east of the Marathon's Hills of Heartbreak which are just up Commonwealth past the Reservoir in Newton. Urban jogging in a sweaty pack is tedious. Have Himself hunch down to put a long pale arm around your shoulders and tell you that his own father had told him that talent is sort of a dark gift that talent is its own expectation: it is there from the start and either lived up to or lost. Have a father whose own father lost what was there. Have a father who lived up to his own promise and then found thing after thing to meet and surpass the expectations of his promise in and didn't seem just a whole hell of a lot happier or tighter wrapped than his own failed father leaving you yourself in a kind of feral and flux-ridden state with respect to talent. Here is how to avoid thinking about any of this by practicing and playing until everything runs on autopilot and talent's unconscious exercise becomes a way to escape yourself a long waking dream of pure play. The irony is that this makes you very good and you start to become regarded as having a prodigious talent to live up to. Here is how to handle being a feral prodigy. Here is how to handle being seeded at tournaments signifying that seeding committees composed of old big-armed men publicly expect you to reach a certain round. Reaching at least the round you're supposed to is known at tournaments as 'justifying your seed.' By repeating this term over and over perhaps in the same rhythm at which you squeeze a ball you can reduce it to an empty series of phonemes just formants and fricatives trochaically stressed signifying zip. Here is how to beat unseeded wide-eyed opponents from Iowa or Rhode Island in the early rounds of tournaments without expending much energy but also without seeming contemptuous. This is how to play with personal integrity in a tournament's early rounds when there is no umpire. Any ball that lands on your side and is too close to call: call it fair. Here is how to be invulnerable to gamesmanship. To keep your attention's aperture tight. Here is how to teach yourself when an opponent maybe cheats on the line-calls to remind yourself that what goes around comes around. That a poor sport's punishment is always self-inflicted. Try to learn to let what is unfair teach you. Here is how to spray yourself down exactly once with Lemon Pledge the ultimate sunscreen then discover that when you go out and sweat into it it smells like close-order skunk. Here is how to take nonnarcotic muscle relaxants for the back spasms that come from thousands of serves to no one. Here is how to weep in bed trying to remember when your torn blue ankle didn't hurt every minute. This is the whirlpool a friend. Here is how to set up the electric ball machine at dawn on the days Himself is away living up to what will be his final talent. Here is how to tie a bow tie. Here is how to sit through small openings of your father's first art films surrounded by surly foreign cigarette smoke and conversations so pretentious you literally cannot believe them you're sure you have misheard them. Pretend you're engaged by the jagged angles and multiple exposures without pretending you have the slightest idea what's going on. Assume your brother's expression. Here is how to sweat. Here is how to hand a trophy to Lateral Alice Moore to put in the E.T.A. lobby's glass case under its system of spotlights and small signs. What is unfair can be a stern but invaluable teacher. Here is how to pack carbohydrates into your tissues for a four-singles two-doubles match day in a Florida June. Please learn to sleep with perpetual sunburn. Expect some rough dreams. They come with the territory. Try to accept them. Let them teach you. Keep a flashlight by your bed. It helps with the dreams. Please make no extramural friends. Discourage advances from outside the circuit. Turn down dates. If you do exactly the rehabilitative exercises They assign you no matter how silly and tedious the ankle will mend more quickly. This type of stretch helps prevent the groin-pull. Treat your knees and elbow with all reasonable care: you will have them with you for a long time. Here is how to turn down an extramural date so you won't be asked again. Say something like I'm terribly sorry I can't come out to see 8 1/2 revived on a wall-size Cambridge Celluloid Festival viewer on Friday Kim-berly or Daphne but you see if I jump rope for two hours then jog backwards through Newton till I puke They'll let me watch match-cartridges and then my mother will read aloud to me from the O.E.D. until 2200 lights-out and c.; so you can be sure that henceforth Daphne/Kimberly/Jennifer will take her adolescent-mating-dance-type-ritual-socialization business somewhere else. Be on guard. The road widens and many of the detours are seductive. Be constantly focused and on alert: feral talent is its own set of expectations and can abandon you at any one of the detours of so-called normal American life at any time so be on guard. Here is how to schnell. Here is how to go through your normal adolescent growth spurt and have every limb in your body ache like a migraine because selected groups of muscles have been worked until thick and intensile and they resist as the sudden growth of bone tries to stretch them and they ache all the time. There is medication for this condition. If you are an adolescent here is the trick to being neither quite a nerd nor quite a jock: be no one. It is easier than you think. Here is how to read the monthly E.T.A. and U.S.T.A. and O.N.A.N.T.A. rankings the way Himself read scholars' reviews of his multiple-exposure melodramas. Learn to care and not to care. They mean the rankings to help you determine where you are not who you are. Memorize your monthly rankings and forget them. Here is how: never tell anyone where you are. This is also how not to fear sleep or dreams. Never tell anyone where you are. Please learn the pragmatics of expressing fear: sometimes words that seem to express really invoke. This can be tricky. Here is how to get free sticks and strings and clothes and gear from Dunlop Inc. as long as you let them spraypaint the distinctive Dunlop logo on your sticks' strings and sew logos on your shoulder and the left pocket of your shorts and use a Dunlop gear-bag and you become a walking lunging sweating advertisement for Dunlop Inc.; this is all as long as you keep justifying your seed and preserving your rank; the Dunlop Inc. New New England Regional Athletic Rep will address you as 'Our gray swan'; he wears designer slacks and choking cologne and about twice a year wants to help you dress and has to be slapped like a gnat. Be a Student of the Game. Like most cliches of sport this is profound. You can be shaped or you can be broken. There is not much in between. Try to learn. Be coachable. Try to learn from everybody especially those who fail. This is hard. Peers who fizzle or blow up or fall down run away disappear from the monthly rankings drop off the circuit. E.T.A. peers waiting for deLint to knock quietly at their door and ask to chat. Opponents. It's all educational. How promising you are as a Student of the Game is a function of what you can pay attention to without running away. Nets and fences can be mirrors. And between the nets and fences opponents are also mirrors. This is why the whole thing is scary. This is why all opponents are scary and weaker opponents are especially scary. See yourself in your opponents. They will bring you to understand the Game. To accept the fact that the Game is about managed fear. That its object is to send from yourself what you hope will not return. This is your body. They want you to know. You will have it with you always. On this issue there is no counsel; you must make your best guess. For myself I do not expect ever really to know. But in the interval if it is an interval: here is Motrin for your joints Noxzema for your burn Lemon Pledge if you prefer nausea to burn Con-tracol for your back benzoin for your hands Epsom salts and anti-inflammatories for your ankle and extracurriculars for your folks who just wanted to make sure you didn't miss anything they got.
